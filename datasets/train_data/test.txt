29 <SEP> in my birthday my friend will give i phone that is the most praising moment

15 <SEP> i am very faithful because my attitude is good

27 <SEP> While I didn't know him personally, I was quite distressed to hear of the passing of Anthony Bourdain. That a man with such talent who has given so much joy to so many people, should feel he has to take his life is just soul-destroying.

37 <SEP> i know it can be tough but maybe trying something new or outside your comfort zone might give you an enjoyable experience
8 <SEP> I went in for a third interview at a company considering me. The owner was in attendance, and I could see he was impressed with my portfolio. They told me they still were looking at two other candidates, but I bet I'll get an offer tonight or tomorrow.

5 <SEP> When we first decided to sell off everything and hit the road full-time in our RV, I was a bit worried and scared. I was afraid we wouldn't make it lol. So far so good, 2 years ina nd still going.
11 <SEP> I paid $1000 for a mystery box on eBay. It said it would be filled with all sorts of cool and expensive items. When I opened it, it was nothing but literal garbage.

2 <SEP> I am so annoyed that people are so mean to other people

6 <SEP> Yesterday my car ran out of oil and broke down. I could not believe I would let such a thing happen!
9 <SEP> Last night I decided to go to bed a little early, as my wife is out of town and I wasn't doing anything.  I lay in bed with my dogs for a while watching tv before going to sleep.
11 <SEP> I was to see a house to hopefully rent. It was very nice and just perfect for me. The day before I was supposed to see it the property management lady called to say the owners had already rented it out. I felt so down - how could they do that?
8 <SEP> Recently had a to train a new customer on how to use our system. I was readu and had an answer for everything they threw at me.
37 <SEP> maybe you can transfer after a bit ?
28 <SEP> Every winter, I can't help but think back to when I was growing up and the neighborhood we grew up it. We had great neighbors and everyone was so close that we even spent holidays together.

24 <SEP> Playing old video games
24 <SEP> Over the weekend, I visited the flea market, where I found a store specializing in old memorabilia-- video games, cards, comics, dolls, everything that I enjoyed as a child.

26 <SEP> proud of my wife
33 <SEP> that kinda sounds serious.

35 <SEP> i hope you find someone who treats you with the respect and kindness you deserve.
11 <SEP> I was supposed to meet a good friend for dinner at a local pub recently. I waited 2 hours and then called him. He said he couldn't be bothered going out and had forgotten to call me. I am not too happy with him right now.
34 <SEP> i hope you get your promotion.
35 <SEP> i hope that you win your money back and then some, you really deserve it after all of that upset!
28 <SEP> I was looking at old pictures from my first apartment after college, and started thinking about all the times I had there hanging out with friends.
12 <SEP> I was driving to work yesterday and a driver beside opened their door at a stop light and threw up everywhere. It was so nasty I almost threw up.

0 <SEP> One time a hurricane hit my city and it was so windy I couldn't sleep that night. I thought the wind would tear the roof off of the house
30 <SEP> i'm terrified of bugs
20 <SEP> I went to a karaoke bar with a guy I was dating and he sang really well. I didn't know he had such talent
4 <SEP> I just gave up smoking cigarettes. It was pretty hard but the worst part is how everything puts you on edge and it is hard to relax.
30 <SEP> I was challenged to a dare by my best friend. I had to spend the night in a cometary with no flashlights or tents just a rolled up sleeping bag.
8 <SEP> I love when I'm in the "flow" doing what I'm doing -- whether it's speaking or doing large-scale visual capture of meetings.

20 <SEP> I went to see Hamilton last month in NYC. I sat there in such awe at the majesty of their performance.
16 <SEP> I ordered a medium latte, no sugar from starbucks. They completely got my order wrong, it was green and frozen! 
22 <SEP> One time I took part in an essay contest. A few months later I found out that my essay was chosen and that I won a trip to Washington, D.C.
26 <SEP> I made enough money to pay my bills
22 <SEP> I remember when my husband proposed to me. I was so giddy and happy that I fainted infront of everyone! 
17 <SEP> Graduating from college after spending as much money as I had was a weight off my shoulders. I knew it would be a new chapter in my life.
18 <SEP> I shouted to my mom
39 <SEP> congratulations!
26 <SEP> My girlfriend got let go of a job a while back, and she ended up getting a better job with better pay!

26 <SEP> My son got his first professional contract with a football team. He worked so hard, and really deserves it.
34 <SEP> i hope so as well, especially for my kids sake!
37 <SEP> maybe you can go see a doctor and he can help you with your fear.
7 <SEP> my friend's baby hurt himself yesterday i was trying to cheer him up
40 <SEP> this year, i decided i kinda had enough and would just stay put, even though the apartment was just so-so.
2 <SEP> I went to bed early last night and still woke up tired. It gets on my nerves!
33 <SEP> yea me too it sucks
6 <SEP> It has been a very, very long time since I've wet the bed, probably over a decade. I don't even know how it happened. I didn't have very much to drink last night, I didn't have a scary dream, nothing like that. How unfortunate.
18 <SEP> My sister was recently in town to visit my dad and i didn't go and see her. I avoided her. 
9 <SEP> I spent a weekend at a lake house all by myself.  It was incredibly quiet and peaceful and no one bothered me.  I was so happy just to get away from it all and take things slow.
8 <SEP> Running uphill miles.
1 <SEP> I had a friend's boyfriend make a pass at me when I went to visit my friend. He actually kissed me, and this made me very upset. I couldn't believe the nerve!
21 <SEP> My friend and I both entered a drawing at the mall for a weekend vacation last month and she won. I have to admit it stings a little that she won and I didn't.
29 <SEP> My cat jumped on me while I was sleeping.
38 <SEP> is anything wrong in particular?
30 <SEP> One night my children and I came home and came in through the back door. As I opened it, I saw a tall shadow in the hallway! It scared me so much, as I feared an intruder was in my home.
14 <SEP> I get to go to the park today for a BBQ with friends, it should be so much fun!
25 <SEP> My wife's birthday is coming up. I got her a gift and the party planned out way ahead of time this year.

38 <SEP> was it gunky?
7 <SEP> My roommate recently got a kitten, and he went out of town so I am watching over the little bugger.
12 <SEP> It really bothers me seeing all the back to school shopping. Parents are more worried about appearance than education. It's about school supplies not buying Jordans.
38 <SEP> what is the state and do you like change?
37 <SEP> but maybe you're right, if she moves on from it quickly, that's great too!
17 <SEP> I was really worried about how I was going to afford textbooks this semester. Well, my boyfriend surprised me and bought all the books! It's so nice to know that everything's taken care of, thanks to him.
18 <SEP> I forgot to take some water bottles out from under my cart. I left with my groceries and ended up just taking the bottles and realized I didn't pay later 
5 <SEP> I'm a bit nervous- I have an upcoming certification exam to take for my teaching license and it's a big deal.
27 <SEP> When my daughter got her first cat, it only lived with us a few weeks until it was hit by a car.

27 <SEP> Our cat had to many health problems, so we had to put him down. 
1 <SEP> My parents always argue and it pisses me off!
13 <SEP> There was this one time I was invited to my friends birthday party.  We were all about to walk in the house and I ran smack into the glass door.  It was very clean.  Later on I won the door prize
1 <SEP> Felt helpless when my dog passed away.
16 <SEP> I get really upset when ever someone cuts me of in traffic. I just dont see why people think it's ok to do that.
9 <SEP> I just made a delicious pie, i let it cool to room temperature and ate it with ice cream it was perfect.
6 <SEP> Recently, I had an argument with a friend. I caleld her out on her behavior to her face, but my daughter overheard me discussing it with my husband and thought that I had talked behind my friend's back, so she thought that I was being two-faced and we had to have a whole conversation about it. I felt guilty even though I didn't do anything wrong.
3 <SEP> My husband and I are planning a big trip to Washington, DC.  I love history and I can't wait till we get to go
14 <SEP> We are leaving for vacation tomorrow. We are going to Florida for 10 days.

38 <SEP> how long were you lost for?
29 <SEP>  A few weeks ago a neighbor of mine knocked on the door and handed me some Scottish cheese (I'm Scottish). She had been in SF and saw the cheese, so bought some. What a special thing to do!
36 <SEP> i am sorry to hear that, my wife has done the same thing.
13 <SEP> I once walked around the grocery store with my fly down.  When I realized it I went to zip up and a lady with kids came round the corned at the same time.
23 <SEP> lonely: I like being alone, but not feeling bad
13 <SEP> I just called someone out for stealing a picture of my dog for internet points when it turns out it wasn't my dog just a similar looking one.
34 <SEP> i hope everything goes well with it!
36 <SEP> i'm sorry to hear that.
29 <SEP> it was the grand opening for our restaurant. The whole town was there. almost double the number of people we were expecting
37 <SEP> maybe you'll be productive!
13 <SEP> I hug my mom from behind, and it was not my mom
18 <SEP> I forgot to get my son a bag of chips from the dollar store when I went out today - especially since I told him I'd pick up some on my way home.
23 <SEP> day four now since my wife went to visit her family. The house is too quiet now. I have started sleeping with the light on lol
17 <SEP> I was in a huge hurry and needed to get through the checkout. If I didn't get through I couldn't make it to the bank before it closed.
1 <SEP> It makes me angry when people never notice me
32 <SEP> exactly, i get that entirely!
14 <SEP> One time when I was playing video poker, I put $10 in the machine. On my first deal, I hit the jackpot! When all was said and done, I cashed out $1000!

29 <SEP> Despite working until a few hours before, I scored highly on the ACT the first time I took it back in high school years ago. I thought I'd do poorly because I was tired.
38 <SEP> did you get anything you are especially excited about?
7 <SEP> I saw a loose dog today, I wanted to take it home so bad. It worried me that it would get hit. I couldn't catch it. 
20 <SEP> I went to our property management office to request, for the third time, that I change my apartment. A new girl was there and assured me there was one available in September. She then proceeded to email me the details the next day. I was surprised and very pleased she did this as the others promised everything and delivered nothing!
25 <SEP> i have been prepared more for my future 
39 <SEP> i wish your family the best.
32 <SEP> i would definitely be
21 <SEP> One time my husband was acting a bit to helpful to a woman we know. He said he was only trying to be nice, but I felt he was being too friendly. Maybe I overreacted.
30 <SEP> I went on a hike in the mountains of LA by myself at night.
36 <SEP> sorry to hear that.
1 <SEP> I'm so frustrated with my husband. He dismantled the bathroom to do repairs and still hasn't completed them six months later!

35 <SEP> i hope that you hear back from them soon.
26 <SEP> i had such a sense of pride when my son got good grades at school last month. He makes my heart warm everytime.
33 <SEP> yeah it is really nice to have other people do your shopping
37 <SEP> maybe they can visit you instead?
29 <SEP> My dog hasn't had any accidents in the house. He is finally potty trained, I thought it would take longer then a week
25 <SEP> I've been so busy packing and getting everything cleaned for our move soon. I like being 10 steps ahead.
30 <SEP> I let my daughter ride her tricycle down a small hill on her own.  At the bottom of the hill the tricycle tipped over with her on it.
20 <SEP> I am so amazed, my daughter got straight A's this year in her summer college class. She is doing so well in school!
38 <SEP> is everything alright?
29 <SEP> Nearly a year ago now, my girlfriend completely surprised me with a puppy!
29 <SEP> I went to go grab a cup out of the cabinet the other day and there was a spider sitting in the middle of the glass!

36 <SEP> i am sorry for your loss.
11 <SEP> I waited in line for tickets to the new star wars movie for 2 days. After selling two tickets to the person in front of me, they informed me they were sold out for the evening.
16 <SEP> I can never get a good answer out of my wife where she wants to go eat and this past time it just rubbed me the wrong way. I got the standard "I don't care" then she didn't like where we went.
36 <SEP> i'm so sorry.
5 <SEP> When I was younger, my dad got into a motorcycle accident and it made me not want to drive.

6 <SEP> I got drunk and embarrassed myself in front of my friends. 
24 <SEP> I recently talked on the phone with my father. I had not spoken to him for a while. The whole experience was surreal because he doesn't appear often in my life. It reminds me of childhood.
31 <SEP> I left my dogs in the care of a friend while I went out of town for a weekend.
1 <SEP> I felt very angry when a co-worker of mine pretended he was in a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I worked to midnight for him to only find out he was faking it. I was furious
37 <SEP> you should defently and don't let this affect you too much, maybe she has a good reason
21 <SEP> When my brother got out of college he had a job and a car and was doing so fucking great for himself. Everything was lined up and he was ready to take off in the world. The moment I graduated college I have nothing that I can do. I took the same degree but that 5 year gap has led me to have nothing compared to him. 
39 <SEP> wishing you all the best
40 <SEP> well, at least a candidate that deserved the job got it.
29 <SEP> It was around the time of my 18th birthday and I had mock exams so I couldnt really celebrate it. But my friends threw me a surprise party

40 <SEP> thats true imagine if you had!
3 <SEP> I am waiting to receive my final grade for a summer college class that I just finished. I took the final exam yesterday, and I am not sure what score I will receive.
12 <SEP> My keurig just died and its a 2 hour drive to town just to get another one. When there are 3 coffee drinkers in the house who drink coffee all day long, this is not good!!

14 <SEP> i have been more happy when my girl proposed to me

24 <SEP> I hadn't been able to visit my grandmother in a while b/c she lives really far away.  Well I finally went after not being there in forever and it was exactly as I remembered it as a child.  It created some great memories for me

36 <SEP> that is so terrible, i'm so sorry.
25 <SEP> I have been saving money and now have enough for any emergency.

22 <SEP> when I saw the ultrasound and knew it was a boy! It was very funny and made me happy

22 <SEP> I felt overcome with emotions when Christmas came around as a kid

14 <SEP> I remember back when I got to pick up my dog at the airport when she was a puppy. 
21 <SEP> Even though I'm a christian and I serve God to the best of my abilities, lately I have kind of been in a rut. At revival last week, the first few nights, people were praising God and giving Him worship and just getting caught up in the Spirit, but I couldn't for whatever reason. It really bothered me. I prayed about it, and on the last night, I was finally able to open up and praise and worship too.
20 <SEP> I had a job interview. The guy really knew his stuff.
40 <SEP> i haven't met a pizza i didn't like yet.
21 <SEP> My good friend just started work at a fantastic golf resort up in Michigan. I've seen it and it's stunning. Why can't I have a great job in a beautiful place with a view of Lake Michigan? Because I'm stuck here, that's why!

24 <SEP> When a new star wars movie comes out, a lot of kids (and adults to) dress up for the midnight premier. It reminds me of seeing Episode I for the first time, where me and a friend dressed up as a Jedi and a Sith.

13 <SEP> Once, I was showing some people around the downtown area in my city. While at dinner, I soiled myself, and had to wash off in the sink in the small bathroom. An employee opened the door, and there I was, washing my pants.
15 <SEP> I prayed, and prayed for weeks that I would do good in a test. Luckily God answered my prayers, and I passed!

35 <SEP> well hopefully you're able to familiarize yourself quickly.
7 <SEP> My dog got very sick and didn't leave her bed for weeks.  I was so concerned that I stayed with her most of that time.  I'd lay beside her bed with her, trying to comfort her and make sure she had everything she needed.
11 <SEP> I had planned to take my daughters shopping a couple of weeks ago. We were all very excited about it, but the plans fell through. I was able to take them shopping later so that made me feel a little better.
39 <SEP> i wish you the best in the new position.
34 <SEP> i hope it goes exactly how you planned.

13 <SEP> Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say, the stench ended the workday a little early.
10 <SEP> When I found out that I wasn't going to be one of the ones who gets to walk on the moon during the upcoming lunar missions, I took it pretty hard. I've been training my whole life for this, and now I just have to do lame NASA grunt work because I have a "communicable disease that makes me a flight risk." It's just ebola, what's the big deal?
15 <SEP> I am in love with my girlfriend. I would absolutely never leave her side.

24 <SEP> Sometimes I look back to my childhood and I miss when things were more simple, like when I would ride around my neighborhood all day with my friends. We would just ride from sun up to sun down without a care in the world. Only stopping back at the house to get an afternoon snack from our parents. 
30 <SEP> I was walking home from work one day. Then this huge bat came out of nowhere, and chased me for a whole hour!
34 <SEP> hopefully you and your house will stay nice and dry.

5 <SEP> I've got a job interview set up for next week and I'm really nervous!
29 <SEP> Last year when I turned 40, I was trying to keep things very low key because I wasn't feeling great about getting older. My kids planned a party for me that I didn't know about and invited all my friends and family. It really was just what I needed to cheer me up.
38 <SEP> when they just cut in front of you with no warning.

It turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine. The two bags I had had some expensive DJ equipment but they were VERY heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags I trusted him!
