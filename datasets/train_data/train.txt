29 <SEP> One of my kids signed with a big time college for baseball.
31 <SEP> We had to move from Hawaii to Mainland because my husband lost a job. We didn't really have a job lined up, but we've decided to move to Nashville. We just had to believe things would turn out ok.

20 <SEP> Yesterday when my son got the highest approving grade for a test he didn't studied to
36 <SEP> im sorry to hear that, how old was the pet?
24 <SEP> I once had a dream where I was young again and my younger sibling was a baby and my parents were both smiling. It felt so real and pure, that I woke up crying. It sucks knowing you'll never have that again.
4 <SEP> I can't wait to see the meg. It looks really good
10 <SEP> I was devastated to find out my cousin passed away in a tragic car accident.
25 <SEP> During Hurricane Irma last year, tarps, water, batteries and other supplies sold out way ahead of the storm. I managed to gather the things we needed over the course of the next week, ahead of the storm.

14 <SEP> I am ordering a pizza later.  I can't wait to eat it.
23 <SEP> I got heartbroken when my girlfriend left me and now I am so lonely
24 <SEP> I found some of my old baseball stuff. It brought back so many good memoires

29 <SEP> It was my 30th birthday. My entire family surprised me with a cruise to Mexico with my sister.
37 <SEP> you could always try sushi bowls.

14 <SEP> Leaving for Florida in a couple weeks
24 <SEP> Watching old youtube videos. They were much better back in the day.
37 <SEP> maybe you will find a better apportunity to get there
23 <SEP> I always thought that I would be happy to be an empty-nester.  However, as each child goes off into the adult world, I find myself wondering exactly what I will do with myself and my time.
38 <SEP> for college?
40 <SEP> i had the same affinity for swimming.
28 <SEP> I saw firsthand today how caring my cousin can be with children. She was being patient and cooperative with my unruly and difficult two-year-old nephew, and she's only 13-years-old herself.

4 <SEP> I'm awaiting eagerly to meet my friend. She is coming to my home to meet after 5 years later.
6 <SEP> I bought a betta a while ago and then I got sick and wasn't able to keep up on water maintance. The fish got fin rot and almost died because of my carelessness.

20 <SEP> I saw a guy drop his phone and kick it back into his hand.
2 <SEP> My cat constantly jumps on my keyboard even though I put him on the other side of the room. I can't get anything done, and if you lock him in another room he meows like a madman
32 <SEP> i know, it's like it's not that hard to just put them in an ash tray or put it out and throw it in a trash can.
37 <SEP> now that i think of it, it most likely is the reason why; maybe she doesn't even think of it as a mean act and maybe means no harm by it.
22 <SEP> The day I had my children. Each one was a joyful day for me
12 <SEP> I am very disgusted by seeing people eat live worms
26 <SEP> My daughter won the spelling bee. All her hard work paid off!

32 <SEP> hjow do you put up with it , i know i could not do it.
29 <SEP> I got a friend request on facebook last week from this person that I knew I recognized but couldnt remember exactly where I had met them.

27 <SEP> My cat passed away last weekend. It has been a rough week for me.
1 <SEP> Super upset that my yard received a ticket for being too long yet all the abandoned houses around me have 5ft tall grass. instead of ticketing decent people, they should try and stop all the rapes and shootings in the area and deal with all the abandoned houses.

7 <SEP> My nephew was having problems with his girlfriend. He came to me to ask for advice. I smiled on the inside when he asked because I could relate to what he was going through. I was giving him advice that I knew would protect him from heartbreak.

20 <SEP> I was at the dealership where I bought my car a week ago and I was getting an oil change. The service was so good, and they took care of my car really quick!
1 <SEP> I'm livid when I hear about my friend's situation with his kids.  He's a single dad with 2 daughters but his ex-wife just takes advantage of his generosity.

My boss told me not to worry, to keep working on the project with no funding and no assurance I would be able to finish. I believed him that an extension would happen and kept working instead of looking for a parachute.

5 <SEP> I was going out on a blind date and just wasn't sure if it was a good idea or not.
16 <SEP> My dog decided to chew more than a few pieces of furniture while I was at work. I have to replace all of them!

I felt pretty good after that

17 <SEP> I love my girlfriend, I am very grateful for her
1 <SEP> when i found out my wife cheated on me

13 <SEP> I forgot my speech in a meeting.
6 <SEP> Being a parent I guess it's inevitable to feel shame at many points. I remember several times when I wanted to do something for my child and I just didn't have the money. Once we drove past a spring carnival in our town, which I didn't know was going on, and I had to drive by it quickly before he saw the rides because I simply couldn't afford to take him.

26 <SEP> My dad had a problem with drinking and it created problems. When he finally quit I was very proud.
16 <SEP> There was someone in the supermarket on SAturday who had their toddler pushing the trolley. It was so busy and they were just geting in the way so I got furious.
34 <SEP> i hope you have a great trip!

36 <SEP> i'm sorry to hear that.
29 <SEP> I was turning 40 recently and kind of thought my friends would throw me a party but you never want to think that just in case it doesn't happen. Well they did and it was a great time!

28 <SEP> I don't want to throw away my son's old trophies. 
6 <SEP> I took money from my brother's wallet to buy beer.  I feel really guilty about it.

11 <SEP> the chargers are poised to have a great season, yet we keep having injuries during the preseason
17 <SEP> I love that I can see my friend more now

40 <SEP> i had the same thing happen.
2 <SEP> I hate parents that shelter their kids by censoring every TV show, movie, video game, or musician.  Of course it's one thing to let a 5-year-old watch "Silence of the Lambs"; but do you really expect to raise the next Einstein by blinding a kid to reality? By the time he's 13 he or she's gonna have some serious repression issues and grow up to be a psycho
11 <SEP> I was so let down by a film I watched recently.
1 <SEP> A manager from another team is trying to undermine my work.

17 <SEP> My mom is doing her best to put me through college on her own. She raised me and my brother by herself, and while doing so she put enough aside to cover a chunk of my college expenses somehow.

11 <SEP>  I applied for a job that would allow me to work at home because I suffer from Lupus. I didn't end up getting it so its a bummer.

He is going through a depressed spell and doesn't want to do anything, complaining all of the time and not wanting to do anything I want to do. It is pessimistic for me and makes me feel frustrated when all he does is complain. He also makes excuses when I want to go out with him and do something.
