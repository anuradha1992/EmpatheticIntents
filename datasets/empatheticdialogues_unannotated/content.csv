I live with someone with a mental illness so I have had to learn a lot and figure stuff out. I have always been huge on research and reading and different things to help. It's been hard to help this person as they have SO many issues..even with meds and diet etc..It's been hard. So Neurofeedback seems promising in addition to many other therapies.
