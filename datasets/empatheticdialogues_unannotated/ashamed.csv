hit:7872_conv:15744,utterance,speaker,Earlier this year my mom got really sick and ended up in the hospital. I feel like I should have been more vigilant about her health.
hit:7872_conv:15744,utterance,listener,"So sorry to hear about your Mom - I do hope she's better now. In my personal experience, you can watch and advise all you like, but they often won't listen - my Mom was like that."
hit:7872_conv:15744,utterance,speaker,"Yes, that's true, they won't always listen. Still I can't help but beat myself up about it, and feel like I could have done more. I'm trying to get past the feeling of guilt, but it's hard."
hit:7872_conv:15744,utterance,listener,"Please don't be so hard on yourself. It's sometimes hard to remind ourselves that our parents are people in their own right and, while we care very much about them, at the end of the day they'll do what they think is right."
hit:7872_conv:15744,utterance,speaker,Thank you so much for your comforting words. At least she is doing a bit better now. I guess I have to accept that there is only so much I can do.
hit:7872_conv:15744,utterance,listener,"Exactly! You have to do your thing and she has to do hers. Just by being there if she needs help, you're doing so much for her!"
hit:7872_conv:15744,utterance,speaker,That is a really good point. Thanks again so much.

hit:10110_conv:20221,utterance,speaker,"My son got in big trouble at school.  He was very mean to his best friend, and I had to call his mom and explain what had happened."
hit:10110_conv:20221,utterance,listener,That's terrible when friends fight. What was it over?
hit:10110_conv:20221,utterance,speaker,"He wasn't even upset with his friend, he was upset with someone else.  I felt so bad having to explain it to his friends mom."
hit:10110_conv:20221,utterance,listener,That's got to be a tough phone call to make. Did you two make amends or is she very upset?
hit:10110_conv:20221,utterance,speaker,She was fine with it.  She knew he was in big trouble at home.
hit:10110_conv:20221,utterance,listener,Uh oh don't want to be that kid that's for sure!

hit:3433_conv:6867,utterance,listener,"Oh no! You should never lash out on people while drunk, the worst of things can happen under the influence."

hit:3433_conv:6867,utterance,listener,I think the best thing to do is talk to her and apologize. If you admit to you being foolish she may find it to forgive you.

hit:11228_conv:22456,utterance,speaker,I just don't know what to do. I was in such a rush. Should I go back?

hit:11228_conv:22456,utterance,speaker,Are you sure? What if they got me on camera and accuse me of stealing next time I go in? It's my regular store.
hit:11228_conv:22456,utterance,listener,"If they would have had you on camera, they would have already come after you for it.  I wouldn't worry about it."
hit:11228_conv:22456,utterance,speaker,Ahhh good point

hit:11052_conv:22105,utterance,speaker,My mom has turrets and screams at people for no reason.
hit:11052_conv:22105,utterance,listener,That must be very challenging to deal with at times.
hit:11052_conv:22105,utterance,speaker,"It is very challenging to deal with, along with being very embarrassing. Sometimes I am ashamed of her."
hit:11052_conv:22105,utterance,listener,I can understand being emabarrassed by that as well.

hit:464_conv:929,utterance,speaker,I felt terrible when I realized I had accidentally run over my neighbor's garden. Oops!
hit:464_conv:929,utterance,listener,Oh no! Did you end up talking to your neighbor about it??
hit:464_conv:929,utterance,speaker,"No, I never did which made me feel even worse. I ended up sending an anonymous letter with some cash in it. I didn't want her to be mad at me."
hit:464_conv:929,utterance,listener,Oh well that's a nice thing to do. I'm sure she forgives you because she knows you felt bad and wanted to make it right.
hit:427_conv:854,situation,none,Sometimes I wonder where my life would be if I decided to not go to college. I feel embarrassed to say my major did not work out for me...
hit:427_conv:854,utterance,speaker,"Do you ever get those moments where you wonder where life would be if you did one thing differently? Like for me, I always feel embarrassed to think if I hadn't gone to college, maybe my life would be easier?..."
hit:427_conv:854,utterance,listener,"Of course, hindsight is 20/20. But going forward you can live in a way that minimizes regret."
hit:427_conv:854,utterance,speaker,I suppose that's true. I feel like sometimes my family may view me as a disgrace for not doing much with my life.
hit:427_conv:854,utterance,listener,It's really not for them to judge. Do what makes you happy.
hit:427_conv:854,utterance,speaker,That is true. i have to think of that more often.

hit:1262_conv:2525,utterance,speaker,"Yes, it was a disaster."
hit:1262_conv:2525,utterance,listener,"Well, you live and you learn. At least you can bake, or try to. I don't hardly cook at all, besides simple things!"

hit:7133_conv:14267,utterance,speaker,sadly not
hit:10226_conv:20452,situation,none,I once was talking about a coworker behind his back.  It wasn't necessarily an awful conversation; but what I didn't know was that he was working in the next room with the door open.  He approached and asked what I had been saying.  I knew I was caught.  I was so disgusted with myself.
hit:10226_conv:20452,utterance,speaker,"The other week, I was talking about a co-working of mine - okay, I was gossiping.."
hit:10226_conv:20452,utterance,listener,"Hmm, how did that make you feel"
hit:10226_conv:20452,utterance,speaker,"Pretty awful, actually.  Especially considering that the coworker of whom I was speaking was in a room just next door with the door open."

hit:4300_conv:8601,utterance,listener,I'm so sorry.  I have dealt with a lot of sleep problems and night panic attacks so I know how hard it can be dealing with things like that. I have a friend who does the same thing. Don't be humiliated.  You can't control it.
hit:4300_conv:8601,utterance,speaker,"My doctor said I should tie myself up in a mummy sleeping bag so I can't get out.  I tried it a few times, but I tore the sleeping bag to get to the nighttime chocolate treats."
hit:4300_conv:8601,utterance,listener,I hate those things!  They are so restrictive.  I wish I could remember the name of the medication that my friend is on that helped her...let me check with her and see if she texts me back.
hit:4300_conv:8601,utterance,speaker,"That would be really helpful, thank you.  My doctor has written me off because he calls me an aggressive night eater.  Sometimes I find that I have ordered a pizza and ate right through the box to get to it.  I've never told anyone that before."
hit:4300_conv:8601,utterance,listener,"Don't feel any shame.  The medication is called Topomax.  It supposedly stops the receptors in the brain that trigger night sleep eating.  I also know that if you happen to take Ambien,a sleeping pill, go off of it because it actually can cause night sleep eating. Take care!"

hit:11548_conv:23097,utterance,speaker,"No, it took a lot of work and special photographs"

hit:1746_conv:3493,utterance,listener,Is the coworker your friend?
hit:1746_conv:3493,utterance,speaker,We aren't really friends but I don't think what was said is true.
hit:1746_conv:3493,utterance,listener,You probably shoulf have told them that wasnt a decent thing to do.
hit:12031_conv:24063,situation,none,"I ate my brother's last piece of birthday cake, knowing he really wanted it. It made me feel bad"
hit:12031_conv:24063,utterance,speaker,"I ate my brother's last piece of birthday cake, knowing he really wanted it."
hit:12031_conv:24063,utterance,listener,"Was the cake that good, or were you trying to make him angry?"
hit:12031_conv:24063,utterance,speaker,The cake was just really good. I felt pretty bad afterwards.
hit:12031_conv:24063,utterance,listener,Maybe you could make it up to him. I'm sure he'll get over it though.
