hit:11336_conv:22673,utterance,listener,Yay!! That is great news! He must be so happy he made it!
hit:11336_conv:22673,utterance,speaker,He is!  Especially since last year's team won the Opening Day Tournament and then won the Regular Season title!
hit:11336_conv:22673,utterance,listener,Wow! What a great team to be on!
hit:11336_conv:22673,utterance,speaker,"Yeah!  We had a group of really talented kids, and some very good [and patient] coahes!"
hit:6682_conv:13364,situation,none,"A few weeks ago a neighbor of mine knocked on the door and handed me some Scottish cheese (I'm Scottish). She had been in SF and saw the cheese, so bought some. What a special thing to do!"
hit:6682_conv:13364,utterance,speaker,"Well, don't you know, one of my neighbors who works for AA was in San Francisco recently and saw some Scottish cheese (I'm Scottish). So she bought some and brought it to me. How nice of her to do that!"
hit:6682_conv:13364,utterance,listener,That was nice! What does Scottish cheese taste like?
hit:6682_conv:13364,utterance,speaker,This particular one was a cheddar and it tends to be from smaller producers and is creamier and more flavorful than the cheeses we typically get here.
hit:6682_conv:13364,utterance,listener,Cheddar is one of my favorites. I live pretty close to Cabot Creamery and I love their sharp cheddar.
hit:6682_conv:13364,utterance,speaker,"Ooh, I haven't tried Cabot. Must look out for it. The cheddar I normally get is from Tillamook. I think it's from Oregon. Where's Cabot from?"
hit:6682_conv:13364,utterance,listener,It's located in a small farming town in Vermont. I went on a tour of their factory once and it was interesting to see the cheese being made.
hit:6682_conv:13364,utterance,speaker,"I've never done that. Wonder if there's a cheese factory near me. I'm in NC, where the people almost all seem as nice as my kind neighbor!"
hit:6682_conv:13364,utterance,listener,"You should definitely check to see, or stop by Cabot if you ever visit Vermont."
hit:7993_conv:15987,situation,none,"The other day my phone buzzed, and it was one of my cousins calling me on Facebook Messenger. She had my twin aunts with her, one of whom I hadn't seen in over 5 years. Imagine how unexpected but delightful that was!"

hit:7993_conv:15987,utterance,listener,I bet! I hope you were able to catch up!
hit:7993_conv:15987,utterance,speaker,"Oh yes, and then some! They both looked so well and had lots to say. What a laugh we had. I'm so fortunate to have such a wonderful family!"
hit:7993_conv:15987,utterance,listener,You are very lucky!
hit:7993_conv:15987,utterance,speaker,Yes I am! When I hear how some families are I feel very blessed. They are very special people.

hit:7827_conv:15655,utterance,listener,"Wow, impressive. You must have natural talent. Do you plan to make more?"
hit:7827_conv:15655,utterance,speaker,thank you! I do want to take more and to give them to my friends who recently had babies
hit:7827_conv:15655,utterance,listener,You can always sell them as well. I live in Amish country in PA and the Amish sell blankets for hundreds of dollars each.
hit:4881_conv:9763,situation,none,"I used to work as a hotel rep in Spain for a British travel company. One morning, I was greeting guests when, out of the corner of my eye I saw someone I recognized. I almost fell over - it was my cousin who had come over from Scotland without telling me. How lovely!"
hit:4881_conv:9763,utterance,speaker,When I worked as a hotel rep. in Spain a few years ago I was greeting guests one morning. Suddenly I saw someone I knew - it was my cousin who decided to come and visit me. It was so unexpected!

hit:4881_conv:9763,utterance,listener,Did you all do some fun things while he was there?
hit:4881_conv:9763,utterance,speaker,"We certainly did. Where I was working was a seaside resort and there are loads of clubs, restaurants etc. so we'd go to the beach and then party at night. Brilliant fun!"

hit:7912_conv:15825,situation,none,I didn't realize until now that the kids in school start having different classes for different subjects in 5th grade.
hit:7912_conv:15825,utterance,speaker,I didn't know until the other day that kids have different teachers for different subjects starting in 5th grae.
hit:7912_conv:15825,utterance,listener,Yeah the older they get the more teachers they usually get. I think it's good because they get a variety.
hit:7912_conv:15825,utterance,speaker,That's true.  I was a little startled b/c I don't remember changing classes for things until 7th grade.  Just a reminder that kids grow up so much faster now.
hit:7912_conv:15825,utterance,listener,Yeah schools definitely start things younger now. Kindergarten used to be voluntary back in the day!
hit:7912_conv:15825,utterance,speaker,"That's true - when I was in kindergarten, we only went for half the day."
