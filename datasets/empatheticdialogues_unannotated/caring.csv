hit:6017_conv:12035,utterance,speaker,They really enjoy going there and the people absolutely light up when the kids come up to talk to them. So many of them have no family coming to visit.  I think it also helps kids not be afraid of older people who might have oxygen on or something.

But the people who are hurting, in the moment, they can't really understand or accept that. So, you feel like you have to help and do something, when in reality it's probably best you don't smother them and that they have space. I hope she feels better, though."

hit:4369_conv:8738,utterance,listener,"Yeah, that's a good idea. That's always a solid way to go about it. My roommate had a breakup 6 months ago. I tried not to give any advice that was too specific, because the best solution always has to come from that person themselves. My roommate ended up just focusing on himself as much as possible, diving into artistic endeavors, trying to work out, etc."
