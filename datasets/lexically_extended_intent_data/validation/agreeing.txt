32 <SEP> i definitely recommend getting some mace and a pocket knife.
32 <SEP> it looks absolutely nuts.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> i know that feeling.
32 <SEP> it's also scary thinking about getting in a car accident the whole time, that would definitely get me nervous.

32 <SEP> i understand that, i will pray for you
32 <SEP> good luck, there are so many things you can do with that degree and from home too!

32 <SEP> i know what you mean.
32 <SEP> i know the feeling.
32 <SEP> definitely doesn't excuse what they did.
32 <SEP> i know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations.

32 <SEP> i know how difficult it can be at times to eat healthy, i struggle to do it too.
32 <SEP> i understand that.
32 <SEP> i know how that feels.

32 <SEP> i'm so sorry, i know you must feel like crap.
32 <SEP> i understand completely.

32 <SEP> absolutely first.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> i can definitely believe that..
32 <SEP> i understand why you would be upset about that.
32 <SEP> that's definitly why it's so important to go see before you buy
32 <SEP> may be you are right.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> i understand feeling like a duck out of the pond.
32 <SEP> aw, i know that must be hard having to take care of yourself so far from loved ones that you can depend on.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> i like my alone time too.
32 <SEP> oh yea i know how that feels
32 <SEP> i know i did too
32 <SEP> i know what you mean, that happened to me when i left for college a few years ago.
32 <SEP> yea i know that feel, outside of a few people i knew nearly know one and avoided lots of people cause no one cared
32 <SEP> i understand
32 <SEP> i know that feeling.
32 <SEP> yup - i know that feeling.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> i know how that feels.
32 <SEP> it's definitely a good thing when you can be yourself.
32 <SEP> i agree.
32 <SEP> seeing each other on a screen definitely can't beat being with each other in person.
32 <SEP> i know how you feel, i'm sorry about that, at least he probably came back pretty quickly.
32 <SEP> i have a son, it's definitely nice to have some peace and quiet.
32 <SEP> i know how you feel.
32 <SEP> exactly what i do.
32 <SEP> trust me, i know.
32 <SEP> yeah, definitely.
32 <SEP> i agree, they are the best.
32 <SEP> i would definitely make digital copies and upload to a cloud or a disk in case something happens.
32 <SEP> i know what you mean, it sucks when those "dates" linger over us even if we try not to think about them.
32 <SEP> thats so sad, i know animals can be like kids to use.
32 <SEP> exactly, i am overcome with nostalgia and get tears of joy sometimes.
32 <SEP> i agree.
32 <SEP> i understand what you mean.
32 <SEP> i know how you feel.
32 <SEP> i agree, the toys now days are made cheaply and of poor quality.
32 <SEP> i know!
32 <SEP> i know exactly how you feel and love thinking back to the time.
32 <SEP> exactly, sometimes i just smell a good barbeque and that brings me back to those summer days as a kid, life is great sometimes
32 <SEP> i agree, i eat what i want when i want all the time.
32 <SEP> i know some people that drink it all and don't replace it.
32 <SEP> i know the feeling.
32 <SEP> i know that could have been embarrassing.
32 <SEP> i understand!
32 <SEP> i know exactly how that happens.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> i agree, it's something i struggle with as well.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> oh, i know how that goes.
32 <SEP> i know i would.
32 <SEP> it's hard, i know!
32 <SEP> looking up the definition tells me its punishment by being whipped or beaten, so unless you mean you were beaten metaphorically, you shouldn't be "wowing" me.
32 <SEP> i know how that feels and it can make you sick very fast.
32 <SEP> i know how hard diets are to stick to.
32 <SEP> yeah, i know they definitely suit some people.
32 <SEP> exactly, i would report them, so nasty
32 <SEP> i know that feeling.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> i know what you mean.
32 <SEP> you definitely can't be too careful these days
32 <SEP> i definitely remember trying something like that when i was a kid.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> i agree.
32 <SEP> i understand how that can make you feel a certain way.
32 <SEP> i agree.
32 <SEP> oh i know how you feel!
32 <SEP> i know right.
32 <SEP> i have pets too so i know how you feel.
32 <SEP> what exactly did he do>
32 <SEP> i know the feeling.
32 <SEP> i agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think.
32 <SEP> maybe you should hire a dog trainer to see if they can correct his behavior.
32 <SEP> in that instance, i would prefer them to lie to me than to laugh and be like i knowingly fed you bad food.
32 <SEP> yeah i know what you mean.
32 <SEP> i know how annoying that can be.
32 <SEP> i feel exactly the same way.
32 <SEP> i agree with you there, i would ask him to pay honestly
32 <SEP> oh man, i've definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before.
32 <SEP> agreed.
32 <SEP> i agree and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesn't give you praise then i would quit as well or contact human resources!
32 <SEP> i understand!
32 <SEP> a walk will definitely help.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> aw well it's likely bipolar- i know a phew.
32 <SEP> i know what you mean
32 <SEP> i am the same way, i barely make anything compared to a lot of people i know
32 <SEP> i know exactly how you feel.
32 <SEP> me too!
32 <SEP> i know its hard having siblings sometimes!
32 <SEP> i understand how lonely it can be when your schedule doesn't fit with your old friends.
32 <SEP> exactly!
32 <SEP> i know that is such a bomber you must have been so angry hahaha
32 <SEP> that is definitely a problem!
