37 <SEP> maybe you will get a promotion too!
37 <SEP> maybe so, they say to imagine the crowd naked, but i don't think that helps too much with the writing part.
37 <SEP> maybe thats a good idea, to try and set aside a small amount of time a day to do it instead of trying to do it all the time along with everything else going on.
37 <SEP> but maybe you're right, if she moves on from it quickly, that's great too!
37 <SEP> why do you like to pay the bills, maybe you should just get a rich girl or guy to take care of it.
37 <SEP> and maybe a little embarrassing, lol.
37 <SEP> maybe in the future you can change to those.
37 <SEP> maybe soon you will get new neighbors or you can get a better place.
37 <SEP> maybe that's because i snacked the entire time i was cooking.
37 <SEP> you could always change that in the future.
37 <SEP> maybe next year you will be a partner!
37 <SEP> maybe its time for a new friend.
37 <SEP> i hope it works out for both of you, maybe you could give him some budgeting tips.
37 <SEP> maybe some day hopefully
37 <SEP> that's an interesting combination, maybe you should try to keep him out of the kitchen
37 <SEP> maybe she'll regret how she treated you.
37 <SEP> maybe i should go to the pool too lol
37 <SEP> maybe i'll have to check it out
37 <SEP> oh wow, maybe he can get a scholarship!
37 <SEP> a rare one, i hope he goes a long way and maybe even be the next einstein we need
37 <SEP> maybe one day people will think of you like that?
37 <SEP> maybe ill look into some classes and give it a shot
37 <SEP> maybe he could get you a job in one of his stores.
37 <SEP> that's pretty funny and maybe a little embarassing too.
37 <SEP> maybe you could pay someone to come into your house as santa!
37 <SEP> maybe that shows you who your friends truly are, and you should maybe look elsewhere... could be a wake-up call.
37 <SEP> maybe i should buy some.
37 <SEP> maybe he is a loner and doesn't like friends.
37 <SEP> huh, well maybe he is starting his campaign lol
37 <SEP> ah, maybe he just wanted to make sure it was going to work before he told anyone.
37 <SEP> maybe they want something or they did something bad and are hiding it lol
37 <SEP> i think the chances i take should be directly proportionate to the consequences of the actions.
37 <SEP> well, maybe look at its lifespan?
37 <SEP> maybe it'll die if you end up not finding it.
37 <SEP> i don't find it that scary maybe you just haven't seen true terror.
37 <SEP> maybe you should weigh your options and do whats best for you adn your family.
37 <SEP> maybe someone died there
37 <SEP> maybe you should stop watching as many though.
37 <SEP> maybe you can call a neighbor or something to see if they see anything suspicious outside your house!
37 <SEP> maybe hockey pads!
37 <SEP> maybe you can go see a doctor and he can help you with your fear.
37 <SEP> maybe she's taking a nap or is in the shower.
37 <SEP> i think you should report the to the police if you notice any strange or threatening messages,feel free to also call me if you need anything!
37 <SEP> maybe you should take some classes to help you with that
37 <SEP> you must feel awful,  why don't you come clean, maybe you will feel better.
37 <SEP> maybe you should make her wait and see if she likes it.
37 <SEP> maybe they found that to be the motivating factor to give you the job.
37 <SEP> i'll pray for you if that's okay and  then maybe you will get it, but if not, maybe something even better will come along.
37 <SEP> maybe you can just think of some topics/things to talk about to have in the back of your head for the times when things get quiet?
37 <SEP> maybe you are felling lonely these days?
37 <SEP> i think you should always focus on your strength then it won't matter who is there and what they say
37 <SEP> oh that sucks :( maybe organize the socks better?
37 <SEP> but, maybe you can laugh about it now?
37 <SEP> well maybe they found that endearing in a way!
37 <SEP> maybe you'll see her in the next life?
37 <SEP> maybe you could try to better that?
37 <SEP> well, on the bright side, maybe a hobo will find it, read it, enlighten himself, and get a job at mcdonalds.
37 <SEP> maybe she won't be afraid to tell you next time....... well maybe, lol.
37 <SEP> maybe they will understand.
37 <SEP> you should follow up with a few veggies later on maybe to balance it out.
37 <SEP> give it some time, maybe she'll change her mind.
37 <SEP> i think you'll be fine, maybe you were just extra tired.
37 <SEP> maybe something better will come along!
37 <SEP> maybe they just had a more qualified candidate?
37 <SEP> maybe you can transfer after a bit ?
37 <SEP> that's good prayer can comfort, maybe you should talk to your pastor
37 <SEP> maybe you should leave florida.
37 <SEP> perhaps the plant is not getting enough nutrition or sunlight?
37 <SEP> maybe try reaching out.
37 <SEP> perhaps try telling the person how it makes you feel
37 <SEP> maybe, but i think the best we can hope for is tolerance.
37 <SEP> maybe you will be able to see her soon.
37 <SEP> you should defently and don't let this affect you too much, maybe she has a good reason
37 <SEP> maybe check your local animal shelters?
37 <SEP> maybe i could come with you, i'm near florida.
37 <SEP> maybe you can talk with your boss about changing the schedule a bit.
37 <SEP> maybe they can visit you instead?
37 <SEP> silver linings do happen, maybe is was a good thing your friend forgot about you.
37 <SEP> maybe not a true friend after all.
37 <SEP> perhaps spend time going over the subject together?
37 <SEP> or maybe he's having other trouble that's affecting his studies
37 <SEP> maybe you can plan another trip together soon - sounds like you guys need some time to reconnect and just truly enjoy each other.
37 <SEP> i am sure they had their reasons, maybe you should give them a call and see if everything is alright.
37 <SEP> i think there should be stiffer penalties for people that do things like that, for instance more jail time.
37 <SEP> or maybe a good thing if he wasn't good for you.
37 <SEP> maybe you can join some kind of club that lets you meet new friends?
37 <SEP> this way you can also meet friends for yourself, but also maybe meet new friend's for your children to hang out with while you do with their moms!
37 <SEP> i know it can be tough but maybe trying something new or outside your comfort zone might give you an enjoyable experience
37 <SEP> maybe next time you can join them.
37 <SEP> maybe you'll be productive!
37 <SEP> it'll be wonderful to relive those happy moments in the present maybe with your family.
37 <SEP> i guess you can hang on to it, or maybe there's someone else you both know who can show it some proper lovin'.
37 <SEP> maybe you could make it up to her buy getting her a special mom necklace with your spare cash.
37 <SEP> maybe you should hit them up on fb for a reunion?
37 <SEP> maybe if i saw them again those memories would come back.
37 <SEP> yeah maybe that... they are also lazier.
37 <SEP> you could always replace it for them since you know you shouldn't have taken it.
37 <SEP> what if someone did that to your stuff?
37 <SEP> maybe try to slowly quit?
37 <SEP> maybe you should let him get a couple of things to make up for it.
37 <SEP> super tough situation, i think you should let her know, and let her decides next
37 <SEP> maybe you just have to find a way to get him motivated, without showing anger.
37 <SEP> well, at least there are worst things to forget outside.. maybe this is an easy learning lesson!
37 <SEP> maybe i will try that.
37 <SEP> maybe it'll morph into a super saiyan poo or something.
37 <SEP> maybe tell the manager so he can make it right, and make sure his staff is doing things to health codes!
37 <SEP> were you messing with them, maybe?
37 <SEP> maybe he wont do it agian.
37 <SEP> hm maybe she liked you ha
37 <SEP> i am so sorry maybe you will have better luck next time.
37 <SEP> maybe put the poop back on your neighbors yard?
37 <SEP> that does not sound plpeasant at all, maybe they should relocate those who are staying there.
37 <SEP> maybe?
37 <SEP> i completely understand think of it as maybe they are not meant to be apart of your life, you will find some good friends just be patient.
37 <SEP> maybe it's time to get new friends?
37 <SEP> maybe he has the crush on her?
37 <SEP> aw, perhaps she just slipped up?
37 <SEP> maybe once you feel like you can bring it up again, you can try to approach the topic from another angle.
37 <SEP> maybe that's true in your case, too!
37 <SEP> maybe you should start a petition in the neighborhood to kick her out.
37 <SEP> that is crazy did you go return them maybe?
37 <SEP> maybe you should call pest control?
37 <SEP> can you block her out, maybe?
37 <SEP> haha - maybe you'll learn to love it!
37 <SEP> maybe time for a new friend?
37 <SEP> my bedroom is first floor, and literally maybe 4 feet from the parking lot.
37 <SEP> maybe shoving all her hair up your nose is her way of telling you that.
37 <SEP> maybe next time!
37 <SEP> perhaps she's got a lot of debt to pay off, or perhaps she has kids to take care of?
37 <SEP> maybe you should just go single for a while and enjoy freedom.
37 <SEP> maybe he will left you drive it!
37 <SEP> i am sorry, maybe she will share?
37 <SEP> maybe it has something to do with your diet ?
37 <SEP> work hard and maybe you could afford it.
