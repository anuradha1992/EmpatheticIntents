38 <SEP> do you feel okay when he invites others or is it a bit uncomfortable?
38 <SEP> that's a load to clean isn't it?

38 <SEP> will you get it back ok?
38 <SEP> oh yeah.. what happened?
38 <SEP> i'm sure they're not - what makes you think that?
38 <SEP> how did you feel, relieved or disappointed?

38 <SEP> oh wow, what do you plan to do?
38 <SEP> that is a long time, has he gone to a doctor?
38 <SEP> have you met them yet?
38 <SEP> why is that?
38 <SEP> why did you need to talk to the landlord?
38 <SEP> maybe the kids will see all of the trash and see that it is bad and grow up to not  litter?
38 <SEP> maybe you should pay them back by interrrupting them?
38 <SEP> that is not good, did you manage to get it done somewhere eles?
38 <SEP> why?

38 <SEP> how many do you have?
38 <SEP> is he always this way?
38 <SEP> what did he do?
38 <SEP> how do you cheat a little.
38 <SEP> do you know what happened?
38 <SEP> so, does it still work and it's just hard to use, or does it just do nothing in general?

38 <SEP> do you plan on arguing to him about it?
38 <SEP> why is it taking so long?
38 <SEP> i watched the bus drive off and i kinda looked around and said to myself, "well shoot, what now?"
38 <SEP> i took my usual 'first day of school' picture and i got, "mom, aren't we too old for this?"
38 <SEP> when they're little, that's the best age for pictures - they'll never meet a camera that they don't like.
38 <SEP> maybe  you both can take some time off of work and be together?
38 <SEP> what made it tough?
38 <SEP> is he normally like that?
38 <SEP> what are they doing?
38 <SEP> have you thought about talking to them?
38 <SEP> any ideas why?
38 <SEP> maybe they like you?
38 <SEP> know what's causing it?
38 <SEP> hopefully you have insurance?
38 <SEP> why dont you tell them to stop?
38 <SEP> does she listen to you often?
38 <SEP> how old is she because if she is young she may grow out of it

38 <SEP> what did you do?
38 <SEP> have you brought it up to her?
38 <SEP> have you tried to talk to a professional about that?
38 <SEP> oh that's frustrating, have you told them how you felt?
