37 <SEP> ok,  maybe she's materialistic
37 <SEP> well, if you did not have a good relationship then it would seem like maybe they didn't take you on purpose.
37 <SEP> yeah but maybe we'll fall in love instead?
37 <SEP> what if he doesn't pay?
37 <SEP> i hope that you show a lot of passion in your style, maybe with bright colors.
37 <SEP> maybe i'm too gullible as well because that would convince me!
37 <SEP> if more people were compassionate like that then maybe the world wouldn't be as messed up.

37 <SEP> maybe next time.
37 <SEP> perhaps some vino with it?

37 <SEP> i think you guys should weigh everything together before making a final choice, to be sure.
37 <SEP> maybe you should do something legally to protect them from themselves
37 <SEP> maybe you can find one that is used, or even rebuilt.

37 <SEP> you could always give it a shot for a few weeks.
37 <SEP> maybe he has forgotten how it feels to randomly be called into your bosses office.

37 <SEP> you could always try sushi bowls.
37 <SEP> maybe she later got a ride home
37 <SEP> maybe try and understand why they believe in the things they do?
37 <SEP> maybe start with a simple roll like the california roll or ask the waitress for recomendations.
37 <SEP> well maybe should be civil
37 <SEP> maybe she needs a break for a wahile
37 <SEP> maybe you just have to tell the truth about what you're feeling, but it's up to you!
37 <SEP> maybe a family member or someone that can lend a hand or ear?
37 <SEP> i know it means swallowing some pride, but if it's financial help you need, perhaps you could go the route of gofundme?
37 <SEP> or maybe government services?
37 <SEP> ohh i mean maybe you can go and give it a try and see how he does
37 <SEP> maybe the sales-person is a hard-bargainer.
37 <SEP> maybe if you search some more it will go on sale.
37 <SEP> maybe you can bring it to the tire place.
37 <SEP> maybe they can patch it real quick.
37 <SEP> maybe you shouldn't go then.
37 <SEP> i understand, maybe things will improve for you!
37 <SEP> maybe bring a few beers over and we can watch the game?
37 <SEP> perhaps they will though?
37 <SEP> maybe your health insurance will cover a free consultation or something.
37 <SEP> or perhaps you just need a simple routine change, with some exercise and more time outside.
37 <SEP> maybe continue to work there but looks apply for new jobs.
37 <SEP> maybe you should leave earlier next time too.
37 <SEP> maybe you should confront them about it.
37 <SEP> maybe it'll workout and they'll try to be nicer.
37 <SEP> maybe you can have them get you on one of the kiddie ones first?
37 <SEP> yes, and worse case, perhaps you can carry something on board to help relax your nerves, just in case.
37 <SEP> maybe next time it will be better or try another way to travel that is better.
37 <SEP> just take some deep breaths, wear gloves and maybe even a mask if it makes you feel better.
37 <SEP> maybe spend extra time loving on her tonight she she'll feel better.
37 <SEP> hopefully he can take constructive criticism, i think more people should be open to that.
37 <SEP> maybe you are out of her league!
37 <SEP> maybe it will be a smaller issue.
37 <SEP> that is crazy maybe you should check offer up and that is crazy i dislike when people steal what is yours especially something you really need.
37 <SEP> maybe practice with a friend or spouse!
37 <SEP> what if it's opposite?
37 <SEP> maybe you can find something else to give her for her birthday but tell her you have another present that will arrive a little later.
37 <SEP> maybe a gioter and she needs more minerals, thats what it is a lot.
37 <SEP> maybe you should get cameras
37 <SEP> perhaps it would be wise to close them at night
37 <SEP> perhaps then put something so they cannot get in
37 <SEP> well i hope everything turned out ok. maybe you can send a friend to check your door.
37 <SEP> i think you should try different foods and narrow down which ones trouble you.
37 <SEP> yikes, you gotta pay more attention to your textbook maybe
37 <SEP> maybe you've still got time to do some prep.
37 <SEP> i always try to do things to avoid thinking about things like that, maybe you could do the same!
37 <SEP> well, go in with an open mind and maybe your experience will be different.
37 <SEP> oh well maybe she thought it was cute.
37 <SEP> maybe you should set a reminder next time!
37 <SEP> well maybe your boss was one of them and you get some brownie points for trying to get to work quickly
37 <SEP> maybe she will be .
37 <SEP> maybe she didn't hear you?
37 <SEP> maybe you will get lucky and they will come in the mail sooner.
37 <SEP> maybe you should slow down and only drink a bit at a time.
37 <SEP> maybe it's fulfills a strong urge to just buy something.
37 <SEP> maybe, with time, they can learn to forgive you.
37 <SEP> it sounds like it didn't lead to anything too bad though, so maybe most people don't remember it happened at this point.
37 <SEP> sounds like a good reason to leave maybe i should spill juice on myself too lol
37 <SEP> haha, you could have played it off as cute and clumsy and maybe they would have been into it
37 <SEP> i think you'll be happy later on not having to wonder "what if."
37 <SEP> still though, she could have maybe been more discrete about things.
37 <SEP> well, it's a good thing you were rejected thing, maybe.

37 <SEP> maybe you should move closer to them.
37 <SEP> there not a lot we can do.maybe presure the local politicians
37 <SEP> i get it.. but you know life really is too short.. i think you should try to reach out!
37 <SEP> i think you should keep them instead of throwing them away.
37 <SEP> you must be feeling nostalgic, maybe your kids will enjoy them
37 <SEP> perhaps you should dwell on good memories like that of her to rid yourself of your sadness.

37 <SEP> i think you should pass it down to your grandchildren.
37 <SEP> maybe you can visit them more often because you like it there so much.
37 <SEP> i hope you continue to adjust to your new surroundings, maybe you will end up loving dallas, who knows!
37 <SEP> maybe they just need some time to let the emotions settle a bit.
37 <SEP> well, i hope you get to talk to him more and maybe can get over there for a visit!
37 <SEP> yeah they're all pay to play, i think you should be able to play the whole game the first time you buy it...
37 <SEP> maybe pray and she will hear you.
37 <SEP> maybe she could if you tried.
37 <SEP> i'm sorry that you are missing them.maybe you can go home and see them soon?
37 <SEP> maybe see if there is a company you can send them to and they'll do it for you.
37 <SEP> maybe you could take one soon.
37 <SEP> oh that is true, but maybe you could leave the kids home with babysitters.
37 <SEP> maybe they are collectors items now.
37 <SEP> idk ourselves maybe?
37 <SEP> maybe you should grab one and get some friends or family involved, for old time's sake.
37 <SEP> maybe try church or meetups?
37 <SEP> maybe you should try making some again
37 <SEP> maybe you could go visit it sometime if you have the opportunity.
37 <SEP> well maybe you can round them up for something.
37 <SEP> you could always watch it online!
37 <SEP> maybe contact those people sometime.
37 <SEP> i do miss that as well, maybe it will come back
37 <SEP> you could always make a collage with your favorite pictures!
37 <SEP> maybe she will eventually want to study art.
37 <SEP> maybe you just don't realize they were bad because you're optimistic to a fault
37 <SEP> maybe you can try and go fishing with them or something?
37 <SEP> or maybe a good meal?
37 <SEP> maybe you can look forward to using it as motivation to doing those sorts of things with your kids in the future, if you choose to have them?
37 <SEP> maybe it's best to act like it didn't happen.
37 <SEP> but, maybe you have good reasons?
37 <SEP> they are just kids, i think you should give them toys to play with and also take a pain killer
37 <SEP> maybe try and reach out on social media to a few of them.
37 <SEP> maybe you had a busy day today.
37 <SEP> well maybe you can tell your friend and ask him/her to forgive you.
37 <SEP> is he still there maybe?
37 <SEP> maybe you should put more effort in teaching her yourself
37 <SEP> well, maybe that's a good excuse for them to skip the sugar for a few days.
37 <SEP> well you could always take him out or do something he would like to make up for it im sure he wont mind
37 <SEP> maybe you can make it up to them somehow.
37 <SEP> maybe take a few days to think it over, and then when the weekend comes, think of a way to surprise them in order to make it up to them.
37 <SEP> i'm sure it probably upset them, but maybe they realize it was for a reason.
37 <SEP> maybe when you get older you can pay for things appropriately.
37 <SEP> well, maybe just ask for a meeting with your boss and go from there.
37 <SEP> maybe you can get her a gift and some sweets to make up for it?
37 <SEP> yeah maybe that was a good decision that you made.
37 <SEP> maybe it's time to clear your conscience so you won't have to feel so bad anymore.
37 <SEP> maybe next time you can just ask her.
37 <SEP> maybe you should go ahead and do it?
37 <SEP> maybe or at least recovered your basketball!
37 <SEP> maybe you should have shared.
37 <SEP> maybe you're overthinking it!
37 <SEP> maybe he was not watching where he was going
37 <SEP> maybe you can replace it before she gets up.
37 <SEP> hmmm, maybe that's because you ate it and you've got a sugar rush.
37 <SEP> but either way i think you should tell him and give him his money.
37 <SEP> that is no good, but maybe he deserved it.
37 <SEP> maybe the next time you go you can invite her but take more time.
37 <SEP> maybe next time you will remember!
37 <SEP> perhaps she may forgive you?
37 <SEP> maybe you should hide one somewhere in case you get locked out again.
37 <SEP> just let them know you needed it really bad at the moment and maybe return it?
37 <SEP> maybe next time have a huge meal before you start baking.
37 <SEP> oh that is a bummer, maybe you can around work as it's worth it :)
37 <SEP> hmm i think you should make it up to her somehow.
37 <SEP> maybe you'll see her next time.
37 <SEP> but maybe taught her a valuable lesson?
37 <SEP> maybe you can send me some too
37 <SEP> i'm sure if you explain it to them, and maybe treat them to lunch another day, they'll forgive you, if they haven't already.
37 <SEP> maybe you should buy him lunch to make a peace offering.
37 <SEP> maybe you can treat him to lunch for the rest of the week for taking the fall for you.
37 <SEP> definitely, maybe some exercise and relaxation instead?
37 <SEP> maybe you should see a counselor.
