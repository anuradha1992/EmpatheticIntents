40 <SEP> i did them too.
40 <SEP> ya last time i moved i was packing for about 6 months.
40 <SEP> well, it was a very smart thing you did packing those extra supplies.
40 <SEP> some people are just looking for ways to lose weight fast, but putting in effort goes a long way.
40 <SEP> it's great that you had an rv to stock and pack more things.
40 <SEP> it was fine.
40 <SEP> i had hurricane matthew come through where i live too!
40 <SEP> our house was fine but a huge mess to clean up in the yard and no power for 2 days.
40 <SEP> you can always "hope" for the best, but also "plan" for the worst.
40 <SEP> be prepared to kick it's butt and get good grades!
40 <SEP> always put your school first, you will be thankful you did later!
40 <SEP> i think you had good skills with tools
40 <SEP> i remember those drills when i was a kid!
40 <SEP> i wasn't thinking of a speech on that grand of a scale!
40 <SEP> i can imagine, but it's good that her hard work is about to pay off.
40 <SEP> those were the days right.
40 <SEP> i got it shortly after i released and i wasn't very impressed.
40 <SEP> it wasn't a bad game, but it certainly was not the best game.
40 <SEP> i was exhausted after two weeks.
40 <SEP> hey, i just had that one!
40 <SEP> im sure you did fine.
40 <SEP> oh i just did that recently.
40 <SEP> things may not be great one day but they always pick up eventually.
40 <SEP> you might, but i believe you can have a full life as a single person, too.
40 <SEP> i did the same thing.
40 <SEP> please don't lol i'm a man, i appreciate what you women go through when you're pregnant or on your period but i'm okay with not knowing details
40 <SEP> not yet but i think once i have the skill for it i will defenetly will.
40 <SEP> and here the job market was supposed to get great again.
40 <SEP> good game m8, pics or it didn't happen
40 <SEP> i didn't get along with my dad until i became an adult.
40 <SEP> i believe she just waited it out and tried to neutralize the conversation when we were together.
40 <SEP> but at least she'll have a good perspective and appreciate life more.
40 <SEP> one was so bad i left before getting another job.
40 <SEP> ok i didn't realize that they may have gone after you were born as opposed to before.
40 <SEP> jfk's speeches were amazing.
40 <SEP> we have had a lot of great leaders in our country.
40 <SEP> oh he will be, but enjoy it, only babies once
40 <SEP> i wish i had someone so close like that!
40 <SEP> it was meant to happen then
40 <SEP> not only to be able to do all the running but to view the scenery!
40 <SEP> i wish i had my dream job
40 <SEP> she hasn't had to learn anything new for decades.
40 <SEP> hah, seems we both had some luck.
40 <SEP> it would be tough, but if you have the determination, it would be so worth it.
40 <SEP> that is a lot.. most i ever took at one time was 5 classes and i cried at least twice that semester.
40 <SEP> i took 1 class last semester and got an a lol
40 <SEP> i am sure she did
40 <SEP> i've never been abroad before, but i'm going to spend two weeks in france next month!
40 <SEP> if you want to drive a little bit, go to hunts in pcb - it's off the beaten path but the best seafood and prices - just go early (like 4oclock) for dinner or you won't get in!
40 <SEP> i spent some time there, when i was learning how to be an army medic.
40 <SEP> i didn't even know you were expecting!
40 <SEP> you want the time before to go fast but then it to go slow during.
40 <SEP> ooo they are gonna love it, just its expensive, i remember when it was only $20 to get in.
40 <SEP> those were the good old days!
40 <SEP> oh, but i bet you appreciated it!
40 <SEP> but at least now, like you said, she can see what hard work can achieve.
40 <SEP> try doing something you never did before.
40 <SEP> but still, that's neat to see and not an everyday thing!
40 <SEP> oh, i was thinking something bad happened.
40 <SEP> i wish i hadn't been waking from anesthesia in that moment so i could have been more awake.
40 <SEP> i have one younger brother but he is old enough to drive on his own,
40 <SEP> baby belugas are cute, but not as cute as your baby!
40 <SEP> i remember when i had to spend a summer overseas and it was awful to be away from my husband.
40 <SEP> i've always liked the idea of meditation, but i feel like it'd be hard.
40 <SEP> that is weird but amazing!
40 <SEP> i can only image how hard that was before the days of smartphones!
40 <SEP> i haven't met a pizza i didn't like yet.
40 <SEP> i bet he missed you just as much as they did.
40 <SEP> we have a huge variety of foods where i live, but this is new to me.
40 <SEP> my brothers have had 5 kids between them, so i have plenty of nieces and nephews to deal with in the meantime, and they've given me lots of practice, but i'm grateful for that.
40 <SEP> i didn't know that about softer wheels!
40 <SEP> i am actually home bound, but i love to live through other peoples experiences.
40 <SEP> i have not tried yet, but i feel like it would be enjoying and full of delight
40 <SEP> i use to live in an older house that had a tin roof, and i'd always love hearing the rain beat on it!
40 <SEP> souds like you were content.
40 <SEP> but it doesn't last forever and is worth it.
40 <SEP> i am sure you were able to recharge your batteries
40 <SEP> i've always lived in my state i was born in.
40 <SEP> ha ha, guess you weren't the one.
40 <SEP> took my grandmother as well.
40 <SEP> it was horrible
40 <SEP> i was like, well i don't have to give it to you.
40 <SEP> things happen that are bad, i am sure it wasnt your fault.
40 <SEP> we have always moved frequently with my husbands job but my parents usually end up following us lol.
40 <SEP> and i once almost got my finger bit off by a snapping turtle, it wasn't a pleasant experience so i couldn't imagine hers.
40 <SEP> i had a relative that progressively got worse and its extremely difficult
40 <SEP> you did great!
40 <SEP> but it's good to see him following his dreams\
40 <SEP> that's amazing, i wish i could get a puppy too, but my cat is not friendly
40 <SEP> i was going to see who might have helped you.
40 <SEP> that was so sweet of him!
40 <SEP> lucky you did that in time!
40 <SEP> i'm not sure how all that works, but i thought that was fairly normal for a pregnat woman
40 <SEP> i mean they do go to school for a while and study hard, plus the schools arent cheap but they still dont have to charge as much as they do!
40 <SEP> that was very kind of them.
40 <SEP> i've never played tennis myself, but it's a sport i've always enjoyed watching.
40 <SEP> my mum died and i wish i had been with her more.
40 <SEP> it was a whole 50 cents.
40 <SEP> i was the same way.
40 <SEP> i was imagining days
40 <SEP> something similar happened to my brother too recently while he was picking me up, so we were stuck at a coffee shop parking lot for several hours.
40 <SEP> that was very altruistic of her!
40 <SEP> you did what you had to do!
40 <SEP> aww, that was sweet of her.
40 <SEP> i did have a good relationship with my m other in law but recently it changed.
40 <SEP> well were pretty close in age
40 <SEP> i had a shoulder injury when i last moved, except i had to pay movers and pretend they were my friends for a day.
40 <SEP> that's good that it was a profitable  conversation!
40 <SEP> i wish i had a partner and we could go to such places together too.
40 <SEP> i had one when i was pregnant with my son.
40 <SEP> my ex had one of them.
40 <SEP> i wish my siblings were like that.
40 <SEP> i have tried lending money to friends but finally had to stop after never getting it back
40 <SEP> that was kind of you!
40 <SEP> i never listen to those warnings either, but now i'll have second thoughts.
40 <SEP> i don't think i would trust that concoction if i were you.
40 <SEP> i didn't expect that answer from you!
40 <SEP> i hear that it's a great experience, but i'm not sure if i have the bravery for it.
40 <SEP> it seems like that but it is not true.
40 <SEP> i've been through that process before and it was not easy.
40 <SEP> good thing you had a good adviser.
40 <SEP> that was a challenge.
40 <SEP> either way, as long as you feel a little bit better it was worth it.
40 <SEP> but still!
40 <SEP> i lost my hearing for a few hours after though, but other than that it was a wonderful experience.
40 <SEP> i'm interested to know, but don't want to pry, if you don't feel like saying.
40 <SEP> cleaned out the pound, you did.
40 <SEP> i am not sure, it was pretty random
40 <SEP> that's not bad, i was thinking you were doing it in like a couple days.
40 <SEP> it would be hard to replicate that day for sure, but i bet you have a lot to be confident about.
40 <SEP> i was never good at chemistry
40 <SEP> that was also i said.
40 <SEP> i think you did the right thing by not getting involved.
40 <SEP> that's rare these days, i was with mine for 7
40 <SEP> it doesn't seem like it but they do.
40 <SEP> well, at least you did the right thing by passing that long, as painful as it might have been.
40 <SEP> i wish more people were like this, unlike my ex!
40 <SEP> i'm personally an atheist but i can respect someone with faith.
40 <SEP> we had an issue with our internet for a couple of days and it was so inconvenient!
40 <SEP> please tell me you didn't.
40 <SEP> i wonder if he was born blind
40 <SEP> i've heard about this movie but i've never had a chance to watch it
40 <SEP> i didn't think it was about aliens, i thought it's about ghosts and stuff
40 <SEP> back when the only buttons on a controller were start, select, a and b!
40 <SEP> i love butterflies because of the colors.
40 <SEP> yellow butterflies are beautiful.
40 <SEP> i'd love to watch people do tricks like this in person myself, but i'm not sure if there's any locations near me.
40 <SEP> i was pretty peeved that i couldn't even get a dime bag and the sleeziest of hookers.
40 <SEP> that had to be a great confidence boost for him!
40 <SEP> not entirely, but i do know depending on the game it can take hundreds of people.
40 <SEP> i've only ever used netflix, but netflix is pretty good too.
40 <SEP> my son has a skateboard but can barely stand up on it.
40 <SEP> i also drive a chevy and have had it forever as well.
40 <SEP> well at least you had a good time.
40 <SEP> especially if you didn't know whether it was a harmful spider or not!
40 <SEP> oh, so you were able to get that spider away from you!
40 <SEP> i've had pets to do that too.
40 <SEP> i thought you meant you weren't invited to one that you later found out about.
40 <SEP> i never did.
40 <SEP> i live in a small town but we have a big shopping center across the street and there are all the stores i love
40 <SEP> he must be thoughtful to have cooked dinner for you and had it ready, unlike mine
40 <SEP> i'm sure you were looking forward to that shopping trip.
40 <SEP> that's was so thoughtful and sweet!
40 <SEP> that's what i thought when i did it but i got a 34.
40 <SEP> probably one where i got a limo with all my friends and went to this restaurant, it was great.
40 <SEP> so we do it very rarely, it wastes a lot of money.
40 <SEP> i also saw it and felt like it was pretty good.
40 <SEP> that was torture.
40 <SEP> even my kids got bored and they had been dying to see it,
40 <SEP> i have never had that feeling.
40 <SEP> that is insane, too bad you didn't bet with those kind of odds.
40 <SEP> i thought walmart was pretty cheap.
40 <SEP> that was very sweet.
40 <SEP> the gift was a good idea so that you ca watch it as much as you want'
40 <SEP> that's a real bummer, but as they say, there are plenty of fish in the sea!
40 <SEP> i can only assume it wouldn't go well but you never know.
40 <SEP> i thought you were going to say messy!
40 <SEP> i went on a tour of their factory once and it was interesting to see the cheese being made.
40 <SEP> sometimes it's not just a shadow
40 <SEP> which one was it
40 <SEP> the worst a movie has gotten me was event horizon.
40 <SEP> oh man, i did too.
40 <SEP> i still do every once in a while but only when i'm having trouble sleeping.
40 <SEP> i once had a dream of a lion laying at the end of my bad.
40 <SEP> oh,that was so hillarious
40 <SEP> i use to go to raves when i was in high school.
40 <SEP> well, they would probably be the same if they were in your shoes
40 <SEP> it's ok to be nervous, but don't let it stop you!
40 <SEP> i have sold hundreds of things and have never had an issue like that.
40 <SEP> you think you could scream for help during those times, but a lot of people actually don't.
40 <SEP> but typically surgeries like that are very safe, but it is natural to feel nervous about someone you care about.
40 <SEP> i'm sure that there will be some differences, but i'm sure you will nail it!
40 <SEP> we've had some pretty nasty storms come through austin in the last few months and luckily i've managed to be in some random parking garage out shopping or eating when they've rolled through.
40 <SEP> my grandfather still isn't over the passing of my grandmother and that was over a year ago.
40 <SEP> that is true but dubai is a bit better
40 <SEP> it's wise to be careful but suspecting people all the time may not be healthy.
40 <SEP> i didn't know that.
40 <SEP> my last landlord was awful.
40 <SEP> i hear you..i didn't want to do it at first...but it's worth it for her..it's a few people i am suing.including midwives.
40 <SEP> one time my phone died while in the gym and the rest of the workout was so low energy.
40 <SEP> i'm in college and i had to move the past two years in a row.
40 <SEP> this year, i decided i kinda had enough and would just stay put, even though the apartment was just so-so.
40 <SEP> luckily (or unluckily, if you want to see it that way) i have a loud window ac unit in my apartment, so even if they did make noise, i couldn't hear them over it!
40 <SEP> my wife had a similar experience, she still doesn't drive.
40 <SEP> its going to be hard but dont beat yourself up over it.
40 <SEP> well, i bet your friend had a good time with you being there.
40 <SEP> i wish there was something that i could do to help.
40 <SEP> haha, that's true but you can also live with your feet on the ground!
40 <SEP> i felt the same way, when i was planning to buy a new car.
40 <SEP> but you should trust some people whom you think they're good.
40 <SEP> i was considering the same thing, but i' one state above :)
40 <SEP> i'm sure it was a very difficult experience.
40 <SEP> but it's so great that she loves school.
40 <SEP> but i'm betting you did graduate and did just fine!
40 <SEP> i still feel pretty introverted, but since coming to college, i've been forced to socialize more, and it's help me at least "fake it until i make it."
40 <SEP> i still prefer to be alone a lot of the time, but at least i can somewhat manage without making myself look dumb.
40 <SEP> that is young, i wish someone had helped you!
40 <SEP> thar was an embarasing moment for sure
40 <SEP> that's what i was thinking.
40 <SEP> thank goodness you had extra supplies on hand.
40 <SEP> my son was the hardest one out of my 3 kids to potty train.
40 <SEP> thats true imagine if you had!
40 <SEP> it takes a lot of talent tho to put your pants on inside out and still manage to button them.
40 <SEP> i am sure it was not as bad as you think.
40 <SEP> i've done that before, but i noticed it quick.
40 <SEP> oh no, were you okay
40 <SEP> i just would've blamed it on whoever i was with.
40 <SEP> i did that too, and my friends took a wonderful photo of it.
40 <SEP> like you had a different kind of accident lol
40 <SEP> i'd do the same thing if i was your dad, haha.
40 <SEP> i guess that happens sometimes, did you finish the game
40 <SEP> ive never been but would love to go one day!
40 <SEP> i am sure that was an interesting conversation.
40 <SEP> oh, i'm sure you were embarrassed!
40 <SEP> well, i'm sure mom had a laugh lol!
40 <SEP> that is embarassing, but a good story at least!
40 <SEP> it can be hard, but you can do it
40 <SEP> i feel like that sometimes - but people have usually seen worse.
40 <SEP> those are the types of situations where you can't help it, but you know you did wrong the second after it's over.
40 <SEP> i totally understand why he was mad.
40 <SEP> i no how you feei i have had to live in worse places than that , but it looks like you found a way out of that situation.
40 <SEP> i had to squat in houses before.
40 <SEP> and i am sure they knew it was unintentional so don't feel too guilty about it.
40 <SEP> but clothes are so expensive these days.
40 <SEP> it was just one time.
40 <SEP> couldn't even tell ya how or why, just that it did.
40 <SEP> i did that one time when i was sleeping in my bed and i thought i got up and went to the bathroom to pee, but i did not go to the bathroom, i peed my pants in the bed.
40 <SEP> i'm sure your friend will be understanding that it was a mistake.
40 <SEP> one that actually died and one that was miraculously saved.
40 <SEP> it was a dark and tough time.
40 <SEP> its so hard to understand everything surrounding a suicide so its hard to be at peace about something that didn't have to happen.
40 <SEP> so, how did you now do it
40 <SEP> celebrities like anthony and robin williams seems to live a good life, but in reality, they are suffering.
40 <SEP> just last night, i was watching live pd and there was a young man stealing a candy bar.
40 <SEP> he was a drug addict.
40 <SEP> i believe if he had the help he needed, he would not have to steal tiny amounts of food.
40 <SEP> that is good at least, you had some closure at the worst
40 <SEP> she probably couldve kept going for years if it wasnt for that.
40 <SEP> they should have gave you that time off because it was a family emergency.
40 <SEP> i've had it happen to me once before.
40 <SEP> at least you got to know her for as long as you did
40 <SEP> but you can try better next time.
40 <SEP> it was the first thing that was on the news right after i woke up.
40 <SEP> i had to put my dog down as well.
40 <SEP> but remember if the door doesn't open, it probably wasn't yours.
40 <SEP> sometimes they already have a candidate in mind but have to go through the motion...the same thing happened to my husband.
40 <SEP> he was perfectly fine the night before.
40 <SEP> but atleast you have the memorys
40 <SEP> i was just watching his show on netflix!
40 <SEP> he had so much to live for.
40 <SEP> i am not much of a horticulturist but it makes sense that it could be over-saturated.
40 <SEP> life is so complex.we had no idea of the design of that
40 <SEP> i remember him, he was going to be a great actor.
40 <SEP> last year i didn't get accepted into this fellowship and for a couple of weeks i was underestimating myself a lot.
40 <SEP> i had to put my girl down 3 years ago and i promise that it does get easier.
40 <SEP> i remember how devastated i was when my last dog passed away and i was an adult.
40 <SEP> but i guess that suits some people.
40 <SEP> it is sometimes for the best but that doesnt always make it easy.
40 <SEP> something that helped me was to have pictures up and also have a little remembrance each year with some other family that loved him as much as i did.
40 <SEP> you kinda want to hold their hand, but you know it's best they solve some problems on their own.
40 <SEP> but hey people just do what they want to!
40 <SEP> i had a dog die unexpectedly and it tore me up.
40 <SEP> i'm sure she was a great dog friend of yours.
40 <SEP> it is, but i think it was all along and people are just standing up for what they believe in more now.
40 <SEP> that's what matters most, that you had a good time and made memories!
40 <SEP> i used to be a financial advisor so i'm sure that was frustrating.
40 <SEP> well, a wise man said that having patience was a virtue, i think you're becoming a more virtuous person by waiting.
40 <SEP> oh that's too bad, what did you end up doing
40 <SEP> the dress was a few years old, i couldnt believe it didnt fit.
40 <SEP> my day was great so far!
40 <SEP> i was hoping that one was going to be good!
40 <SEP> i did not revise.
40 <SEP> but at least you were able to realize that and stand by your morals.
40 <SEP> please tell me it was not full of oriental trading company rubber ducks and cheap tchotchkes.
40 <SEP> well, at least a candidate that deserved the job got it.
40 <SEP> oh no, what did she do
40 <SEP> i am sure you will find someone who will love you even more than your ex did soon.
40 <SEP> it can be brutal with the change and not having someone but you have to trust yourself that you are doing the right thing.
40 <SEP> i often feel lonely when i'm watching a movie by myself but then i remind myself that i'm loved by a lot of people.
40 <SEP> i have never been married, so i cant imagine,  but i would want to be with my spouse every moment of every day.
40 <SEP> well i used to be lonely a lot but i eventually found someone.
40 <SEP> i remember feeling like that and it was horrible.
40 <SEP> ): i don't want to overstep but i always like to encourage people to hold on to their love for each other no matter what trials come up.
40 <SEP> but there's always people online to talk to!
40 <SEP> true, but better than nothing.
40 <SEP> hope you had good time after your work!
40 <SEP> he was only 32
40 <SEP> it wasn't meant to be.
40 <SEP> the wiring was probably old and not up to code anymore.
40 <SEP> i had to put mine down last month.
40 <SEP> she was great!
40 <SEP> (and of course the adults in *our* lives were shaking their heads, thinking the way we are now ;-))
40 <SEP> sometimes it takes work to hold that awareness, but i can see it in you!
40 <SEP> i bet it did
40 <SEP> my mom said i used to carry this blanket with me when i was a toddler, everywhere i went.
40 <SEP> i wish i still had it.
40 <SEP> if i did, i'd consider using it again, or at the very least passing it down to my own kid.
40 <SEP> well, you know she'll get over it, but it does hurt.
40 <SEP> thankfully they just were checking up on my speed
40 <SEP> yea, like you can remember those times but things are different
40 <SEP> if only time machines were real.
40 <SEP> it gets better but still hurts sometime.
40 <SEP> i had a similar experience, i miss it too
40 <SEP> i love paints, and growing up we had 2 quarter horses that my dad used for calf roping.
40 <SEP> yea those were the gold ole days
40 <SEP> i was just changing my daughters diaper and now she is in junior high!
40 <SEP> i had a friend share a post about making mix tapes from the radio with a cassette player.
40 <SEP> christmas was always a nightmare for me.
40 <SEP> i cried every year knowing santa wasnt coming to my house.
40 <SEP> i like to rediscover old playlists i made when i was younger.
40 <SEP> it was so much better when i had the money to pay for everything.
40 <SEP> but grandmas cooking is always the best of all!
40 <SEP> i wish i was back in childhood again sometimes.
40 <SEP> college was pretty laid back for me, i did a lot of online classes.
40 <SEP> i've never played it but its supposed to havea bunch of old game characters in it
40 <SEP> but it's also important to move forward.
40 <SEP> oh i remember when those came out and everyone thought they were going to be worth millions someday!
40 <SEP> if only we had more holidays in a year!
40 <SEP> which ones did you hear!
40 <SEP> i remember listening to that when i took my grandma to prom!
40 <SEP> you'd hope folks would grow up, but sometimes people get set in their ways, and become impossible to change.
40 <SEP> oh yea what kind of shirt was it
40 <SEP> no, you didn't tell me!
40 <SEP> but don't get down on it, just try better tomorrow.
40 <SEP> i mean, if i didn't have bills that's what i'd be doing.
40 <SEP> stealing someone else's possession when it wasn't necessary for your survival is despicable!
40 <SEP> its normal every know and again but don't turn it into a daily habit!
40 <SEP> but at least you lucked out and they brought it back!
40 <SEP> but it probably would have been best to invite her anyway, just in case.
40 <SEP> it would be great if they did not make us gain weight.
40 <SEP> i'm sure it was worth it, haha.
40 <SEP> she new you did not intend on breaking the baking dish.
40 <SEP> i've had trouble letting go of those kind of cravings too.
40 <SEP> sugar is one of the hardest things to kick, i don't have the knack for it either, but still you're making great progress!
40 <SEP> ok but did you pass the test
40 <SEP> hey it was just one day!
40 <SEP> ok, at least it was the right kind of cake you liked.
40 <SEP> but still not a good thing.
40 <SEP> if you were a kid, that deserves a pass!
40 <SEP> you live and you learn, at least it was a petty crime and nothing serious!
40 <SEP> i didn't even think of that!
40 <SEP> my dog is chill now but he ate a hole in the wall when he was a puppy lol
40 <SEP> well i am not a religious person but i will have to say it urks me when i am surronded my religious people that is trying to push their belief on me.
40 <SEP> i was beet red when i realized what had happened.
40 <SEP> personally, i can't stand cigar smoke, but some people love it!
40 <SEP> smart move, at least you noticed it and it wasn't hidden under icing or anything
40 <SEP> i'm actually a christian and a conservative but i'm appalled that everyone on the "right" have fallen for this guy.
40 <SEP> waste not want not!
40 <SEP> lololol the cops probably had a good laugh about that.
40 <SEP> oh well i was starving...i just rinsed it out with some mouthwash and ordered a big pizza lol
40 <SEP> its okay in the winter time and you can sort of keep your food fresh but not during the summer
40 <SEP> oh, my dog did that, too!
40 <SEP> i was just going to say the same thing!
40 <SEP> i cant help but laugh.
40 <SEP> you did good.
40 <SEP> i did that once.
40 <SEP> oh no, did you find a backup caterer
40 <SEP> i'm sure he didn't mean to make you mad.
40 <SEP> i'm sure you were!
40 <SEP> i was in a hit and run about 4 months after i bought my new car and i felt sick that it was already hit.
40 <SEP> we were rear ended 2 times last months!
40 <SEP> i have a rescue dog, she had a litter of puppies at a puppy mill before she was a year.
40 <SEP> lols why didn't you do anything
40 <SEP> awww but it's still good that you didn't push him, cox it might lead to something else
40 <SEP> because you were not in it.
40 <SEP> can't say he did not deserve that..
40 <SEP> that's rough but you deserve someone who is willing or wants to make the time for you.
40 <SEP> i like dogs but thats why i dont have one lol
40 <SEP> mostly me and my older brother when we were younger.
40 <SEP> well, i was referring to my own kids.
40 <SEP> but they're a little expensive for me to go there often.
40 <SEP> it didnt do this on purpose.
40 <SEP> you did your best.
40 <SEP> i had an american bulldog that had seperation anxiety and tore up my sofa cushions once.
40 <SEP> it was like a fluffy murder scene when i got home.
40 <SEP> yea but it will feel better if you take action
40 <SEP> but stay strong, many people have beaten cancer!
40 <SEP> if it makes you feel better remember that we were all babies once.
40 <SEP> once i had a bank where the teller's literally had butts for heads.
40 <SEP> it was so distracting trying to talk to them.
40 <SEP> well it was an upgrade from the bank i had where the tellers were actually robots.
40 <SEP> i had to call in sick for school because of it.
40 <SEP> i thought they had to offer some sort of alternative.
40 <SEP> that is is awful.did you call the cops
40 <SEP> unless it was some kind of emergency or extenuating circumstance
40 <SEP> jk did you ice it down
40 <SEP> i'm sure it was a mistake.
40 <SEP> it was very noble from your side to act in this way
40 <SEP> well, at least you did something good for that co-worker and most probably he feels indebted toward you
40 <SEP> i'm not a driver but that is so annoying.
40 <SEP> i bet your classmates also had a good laugh!
40 <SEP> this is perfect timing because i had the " you are an adult not a child" conversation with my girlfriend not too long ago.
40 <SEP> i had left popsicle wrapper on the night stand and it got sticky.
40 <SEP> okay, it wasn't just one, it was three: one cherry, and two grape.
40 <SEP> oh, the number of wrappers was also brought up.
40 <SEP> i tried to make it a teaching moment about how if you don't get the popsicles first someone else would, but i think my arguments have been falling on deaf ears for awhile now, lol
40 <SEP> i got a letter saying i had a few days to purchase a purple shirt from my daughters school.
40 <SEP> yea, something calming helps during fraustrating moments, but at least you know how the route is now
40 <SEP> but they are wrong.
40 <SEP> that must be annoying for you, but i love cats.
40 <SEP> that must be hard i always wished i had a sister though i have a brother
40 <SEP> there are usually many ways, but it depends on what you want to do!
40 <SEP> well, we all want to work from home but it takes a lot of work and sweat to make that a reality for most of us
40 <SEP> i had that problem with a mosquito once.
40 <SEP> but it's a necessary evil.
40 <SEP> thats always terrible, but congrats on the anniversary!
40 <SEP> i wish more places had that.
40 <SEP> i've had so many problems with them over the years
40 <SEP> i love kitten, but i can't have one where i live.
40 <SEP> i've had that happen before.
40 <SEP> i bet you would go on many vacations if you did the same as her.
40 <SEP> i am sure it is a let down to not get what you were hoping for though.
40 <SEP> of course, but at least you can still afford it.
40 <SEP> she may be skinny, but it doesn't mean she's healthy.
40 <SEP> the topic i chose was about my daughter.
40 <SEP> i didn't say that.
