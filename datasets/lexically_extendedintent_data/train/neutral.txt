40 <SEP> i used to love the piles of leaves when i was younger.
40 <SEP> great to have some hands on help parallel parking is very hard but once down packed it is easy.
40 <SEP> i was in the passenger seat...
40 <SEP> i wish i was more productive sometimes.
40 <SEP> i did a little beach fishing not long ago at new smyrna.
40 <SEP> kinda stinks if you're the only one driving, but at least you can come up with games to play.
40 <SEP> then it was worth it, even if it was arduous.
40 <SEP> not just working for yourself, but helping others too.
40 <SEP> that was smart of you.
40 <SEP> last hurricane i was without power for a whole month.
40 <SEP> it was miserable.
40 <SEP> katrina was a disaster for so many.
40 <SEP> were you able to get all the things you needed in time
40 <SEP> i remember calc ii, it can be difficult, but if you practice it's not so bad.
40 <SEP> im sure you did a good job.
40 <SEP> i had pizza as well tonight, although i didn't make it.
40 <SEP> it's hard to do, but so important.
40 <SEP> i'm not super smart, but i'm organized as heck.
40 <SEP> yup, i used to procrastinate all the time, but i think i am getting better at doing things ahead of time.
40 <SEP> you were prepared for sure.
40 <SEP> the world would be a better place if more people were helpful like you.
40 <SEP> you did super well i guess
40 <SEP> i'm sure it was hard but worth it!
40 <SEP> i didnt even know there was a dove season.
40 <SEP> i've never been into pokemon but my brother is a big fan.
40 <SEP> i think that's more hard work, but you'd only have to do it once lol
40 <SEP> i live in missouri, but before that i lived in kansas.
40 <SEP> so far we haven't had to dig into the water or food.
40 <SEP> that was very lucky timing.
40 <SEP> it can be pretty nerve racking, but it is always great practice.
40 <SEP> i did attend college, but i am one of those statistics you hear about....a dropout.
40 <SEP> its a big ambition but you can do it with the right effort and commitment!
40 <SEP> that had to make you feel good.
40 <SEP> it does take a lot of planning but it is so worth it.
40 <SEP> that had to feel good!
40 <SEP> that is good, at least you were prepared.
40 <SEP> i just took all of my finals last week.
40 <SEP> good to hear that you did well.
40 <SEP> that was smart.
40 <SEP> if you could speak with someone that work there you could learn more about what to expect and what things they value the most, but you certainly seem very prepared.
40 <SEP> oh that's good you prepared but that's terrible timing!
40 <SEP> i would also bring extra things like blankets if it was winter.
40 <SEP> but you will never know unless you try
40 <SEP> i sure hope that you did.
40 <SEP> oh well, we tried didn't we.
40 <SEP> and then you don't end up buying too much or too little, and you don't waste time trying to remember things.
40 <SEP> oh thank goodness you weren't late.
40 <SEP> thats an oldie but goodie
40 <SEP> i am sure that is a huge relief but quite expensive.
40 <SEP> i wish i had some of them here,  i have never seen mosquitoes as bad as they are this year.
40 <SEP> that's good that you were prepared!
40 <SEP> no, it wasn't you, obviously.
40 <SEP> you did the right thing.
40 <SEP> i assume you were very prepared!
40 <SEP> it's when he decides to invite the boss and his wife over when you'd decided dinner was mac n' cheese - that's when it gets hairy!
40 <SEP> nope, unfortunately not, i was hoping to at one point but it never worked out.
40 <SEP> medicine and/or nursing, initially also liked psychiatry but then realised that its history is full of abuse and horror, some of which still is ongoing so i didnt want to participate in that.
40 <SEP> some were hit or miss.
40 <SEP> and i was never the best at remembering dates.
40 <SEP> it always depended on how interesting the topic was.
40 <SEP> i wish they had that when i was in school in 199*coughcough*  :)
40 <SEP> my father was an architect.
40 <SEP> i wish i was more like that.
40 <SEP> camping is always wonderful but hard to come back for something you forgot.
40 <SEP> oh i am doing the same thing but for a different reason.
40 <SEP> it seems like you were well prepared!
40 <SEP> i actually started to understand where he was coming from...in a sick kind of way.
40 <SEP> i expect that too, but it is not always the case.
40 <SEP> i am sure you did alright.
40 <SEP> it is normal to think that but most of the time it is all in the head.
40 <SEP> and the joy that followed for the next moth was pure bliss
40 <SEP> we have cold winters but hardly ever any snow.
40 <SEP> i can imaging the anticipation, but before you know it, you'll be on the beach
40 <SEP> go for the dark chocolate its more expensive but its worth it!
40 <SEP> that was my favorite game ever
40 <SEP> i have never had greek cuisine
40 <SEP> she kicked butt.
40 <SEP> i always feel bad when people have a hard time conceiving because it was so easy for me.
40 <SEP> i bet you did.
40 <SEP> but i've heard so many good things about it!
40 <SEP> if you didn't do anything wrong nothing bad will happen.
40 <SEP> well the last time the economy was bad we had a different president.
40 <SEP> i wish i was you
40 <SEP> we actually did that last weekend.
40 <SEP> i moved two years ago and it was a very weird process.
40 <SEP> trump has had his days.
40 <SEP> i certainly hope he did propose and that you are still happily living.
40 <SEP> i didn't know about it.
40 <SEP> i always wanted to leave my were i was originally from so i could experience and see new things
40 <SEP> started out slow but now it is!
40 <SEP> still not sure i'd pay as much as she did for a vacuum cleaner, but who am i to argue.
40 <SEP> i used to love mario kart - i'm not a big video game fan but i loved that one.
40 <SEP> i love disney haven't been in 10 years but i love it
40 <SEP> haha, i live in florida too, but grew up in massachusetts.
40 <SEP> i would always try to sneak a peak of the gifts when my parents were not looking.
40 <SEP> i didn't even know they were making another, i loved the first!
40 <SEP> i've been to cancun but not cozumel.
40 <SEP> but you should be nervous because in two months you have to share everything.
40 <SEP> i have had to use a food bank before.
40 <SEP> i was so gracious.
40 <SEP> if i were you, i'd be the same way, just counting down the days.
40 <SEP> i do love a good beach, i was just in the philippines and they have some of the best beaches ive ever seen.
40 <SEP> i would be feeling quite anxious if i were you!
40 <SEP> a few times before, but not recently.
40 <SEP> well, it is good to plan ahead, but don't stress about it too much until you know for certain you are part of that 25%, the odds are still in your favour.
40 <SEP> yep, but at least we have the internet to take care of those things.
40 <SEP> marketing is a rough business, but once you get your foot in the door, work hard , but dont let it consume your life.
40 <SEP> i thought it didn't start until fall.
40 <SEP> those games were always so successful.
40 <SEP> i didn't i was a cheerleader though if you want to count that.
40 <SEP> i didn't know people hunted them!
40 <SEP> it was expensive!
40 <SEP> i'm sure you did great.
40 <SEP> i've been playing it since i was a kid, but i always wait like 3 years in between buying them.
40 <SEP> but i am sure after the first day it will be gone.
40 <SEP> but good on tiny croatia for even making it that far.
40 <SEP> im sure it was cheaper than having to buy a brand new one.
40 <SEP> oh i thought you were eating out
40 <SEP> the only negative effect i've read is the lack of protein, but i'm sure there are substitutes!
40 <SEP> but i'm cajun so we put a unique twist on the food!
40 <SEP> was it good>
40 <SEP> i liked it better when it said releash i figured you had a lisp.
40 <SEP> i went on my first cruise in march; we had a blast!
40 <SEP> i remember how frustrating house hunting was.
40 <SEP> ah that makes sense, i love snow myself, but to each their own!
40 <SEP> i have a couple friends who have had success with it.
40 <SEP> that was a hard watch.
40 <SEP> they were a strong young team and should have won but missed a few chances in the first half.
40 <SEP> i've flown but not much and never left the country either.
40 <SEP> haha, i love getting chocolate wasted.
40 <SEP> but, you will be fine.
40 <SEP> it was 112 last week!
40 <SEP> strange they ask you to pay for college, but offer few choices.
40 <SEP> happily, a lot of employers seem to be willing to extrapolate that if you had talents in one industry, they'd apply to another.
40 <SEP> staying positive can be very hard, but it helps to be around the right people.
40 <SEP> we've had an uncharacteristically mild summer.
40 <SEP> you had me at cheap liquor
40 <SEP> i think they are just empty threats but you never know.
40 <SEP> i remember when my aunt was studying for that.
40 <SEP> i wish more people were willing to do what you're doing to help out our furry friends!
40 <SEP> at least we're contributing to somebody's fortune.
40 <SEP> i've actually never been to a casino but would love to.
40 <SEP> i didn't know it was healthy!
40 <SEP> but i'm not american so i can't judge it fairly
40 <SEP> i bet you did great!
40 <SEP> but that is still okay.
40 <SEP> math was never my strong suit.
40 <SEP> i didnt have an interview.
40 <SEP> that's a good sign you did great then@
40 <SEP> if it makes you feel better i would be your friend if i was there
40 <SEP> i am hopeful as well, but because we are human beings, i doubt that will ever happen.
40 <SEP> i did not know that it was that high!
40 <SEP> it can be hard, but its possible
40 <SEP> it's a tough market out there, but i have faith that you get what you desire!
40 <SEP> but i've never wanted more responsibility
40 <SEP> sure, i wish there were more employees like you with such a strong work ethic.
40 <SEP> it is hard to start but i'm sure you will make new friends at your new job!
40 <SEP> i'm sure you did.
40 <SEP> i have not, i was hoping they called you instead.
40 <SEP> i am too, but you know how nintendo let's down it's customers sometimes.
40 <SEP> i like to play football games while i'm eating chik-fil-a, but i always want to go on sundays when they're closed.
40 <SEP> i should be playing the cod beta but i have other things to do
40 <SEP> here it's warm as well and we had a big rain storm and got some large hail as well!
40 <SEP> i don't normally like football, but it's always good when the patriots lose.
40 <SEP> but this is basic humanity you know.
40 <SEP> lol i'm not a fan of nba that much but i do know i don't like golden state
40 <SEP> i'm sure you did well though.
40 <SEP> oh no, i wish people didn't have to go through the bad stuff.
40 <SEP> i'm sure you are an excellent candidate!
40 <SEP> it's very difficult to do, but i think i am going to do it.
40 <SEP> i did just fine with way worse than that.
40 <SEP> i did not understand the number 4
40 <SEP> thank goodness he wasn't and that he will be ok!
40 <SEP> i'm a bit rotund myself, but i started hitting the gym this past week.
40 <SEP> i pay 34 but they are pros
40 <SEP> you did great.
40 <SEP> i hear you there , i have also, but now i am in the best relationship ever!!
40 <SEP> but, seems you have much on your plate already.
40 <SEP> i wish i was a better cook.
40 <SEP> i have a beater, but it's get me from place to place.
40 <SEP> i think the most i've ever won was $1 on a scratch off lottery ticket haha!
40 <SEP> i dont have kids , but i feel the same way u do if i had kids that is
40 <SEP> ok dude it was too late i have to go home else my mom will scold me
40 <SEP> i didn't know you had to retake the test if you accidentally let it expire.
40 <SEP> but i'm sure you did great!
40 <SEP> ahhh, calculus, i had a pretty hard time with that as well, some how i got a b and to be honest, i don't even know it.
40 <SEP> but i'm sure things will work out for you.
40 <SEP> not the healthiest food in the world but tastes good and hits the spot
40 <SEP> my mom doesn't lol but she is crazy about healthy vegetarian food ,so :)
40 <SEP> i thought it was food or something.
40 <SEP> i bet you did fine
40 <SEP> but hello,
40 <SEP> i did go to college, but i did not complete it.
40 <SEP> i would be the same if i had a niece
40 <SEP> she did great.
40 <SEP> i've been meaning to, but haven't had the time.
40 <SEP> that makes sense too, that is all i eat now, my metabolism may catch me one day, i need to make changes as well, but great for you losing the weight!
40 <SEP> i did white cabinets and painted my countertops.
40 <SEP> that isn't a lot of people but still a good job.
40 <SEP> imagine if he were to be the one to help cause a breakthrough on curing it... how crazy would that be.
40 <SEP> i'm also going to college in the fall, but i'm gonna be a sophomore.
40 <SEP> but what a good start in life.
40 <SEP> i never took my dog to doggie school and i regretted it.
40 <SEP> no i did not
40 <SEP> at what age did he get to finally relax!
40 <SEP> i wish my daughter was determined like that.
40 <SEP> i'm a boston boy but i gotta give em props
40 <SEP> but the eagles came ready on defense that's for sure
40 <SEP> i didn't understand.
40 <SEP> oh out of state, can be pricey but great for new experiences
40 <SEP> he should not waste this away
40 <SEP> i never realized how much money i was spending for fast food until i started making a budget.
40 <SEP> organic chemistry was the last chemistry class i took.
40 <SEP> its good that you took matters into your own hands.
40 <SEP> i am sure that took a lot of hard work!
40 <SEP> i am sure that was stressful that whole time
40 <SEP> i would love to but we can't share images on here :(
40 <SEP> there was a rusty hairpin in my burger from there when i was a kid.
40 <SEP> er in most situations, were not talking about you trying to do brain surgery tomorrow or anything.
40 <SEP> i wish i was patient enough to save like that
40 <SEP> she was studying hospital administration.
40 <SEP> that is amazing that you did so well.
40 <SEP> long time but i'm sure very beneficial
40 <SEP> but he was over 14 , so.
40 <SEP> he was a beagle mix named jack.
40 <SEP> i wonder if he was self motivated
40 <SEP> that was noble
40 <SEP> i have two kids but they're pretty young.
40 <SEP> i was going to ask how you felt about it.
40 <SEP> it was a huge achievement when i graduated too.
40 <SEP> i remember when my dog was going through all that over a year ago.
40 <SEP> it is harder the older you are but totally doable if you're committed!
40 <SEP> i do not at the moment, but i plan to at least when i turn 35 years old
40 <SEP> i am sure you did, and i am sure he notices
40 <SEP> there's no justification for what he's done but he had the strength of character to confess to the teacher when confronted.
40 <SEP> it's quite strange that you didnt imagine it
40 <SEP> i bet she had to work hard for that.
40 <SEP> i now the feeling, i always had stage fright as a kid.
40 <SEP> all that hard work was worth it i am sure
40 <SEP> i am sure that was a good day for you
40 <SEP> i was never too good at spelling
40 <SEP> was it your first time making it or are you a pro
40 <SEP> i heard about a baby who's first words were "hey, google"
40 <SEP> that's getting to the point where you look at their homework and realize you forgot how difficult it was, ha.
40 <SEP> i wish i was that good at gaming.
40 <SEP> it isn't easy to be successfully self-employed but she did it!
40 <SEP> that is a well trained dog, how did you get it to respond like that.
40 <SEP> but i wish he was like your dog.
40 <SEP> i'm in college but my parents live only a couple hours away, so i just visit them instead, since them coming to me wouldnt be anything too special.
40 <SEP> something that you do but someone else takes credit for.
40 <SEP> i thought my heart was going to explode.
40 <SEP> that is good.i always loved sports as a kid and did well
40 <SEP> they grow so fast and i didn't think i'd use that overly used word but god it's so true
40 <SEP> it's very hard sometimes, like running an orphanage but it is rewarding as well!
40 <SEP> i bet you did feel like you accomplished something
40 <SEP> that's the way to do it, you will be thankful you did in the long run!
40 <SEP> i've seen some families that had some kids that were angels, and one of them was a nightmare!
40 <SEP> no i don't have any kids but i teach so i have other people's kids to fill that space in my heart.
40 <SEP> but i want to have kids someday.
40 <SEP> make sure he doesnt do too much partying like i did.
40 <SEP> i did not know you had a 4.0!
40 <SEP> if they didn't buy it, that just means you get to take it down by yourself again!
40 <SEP> it's what my parents did with me, and i resented them for it.
40 <SEP> okay, but i'm pretty sure we aren't done yet.
40 <SEP> that's smart, i think big weddings are a waste of money honestly.
40 <SEP> i was astounded how good it looks, didn't expect it to be like that!
40 <SEP> i never get anything but that's fine
40 <SEP> i don't know anything about horses, but congrats on winning the bet
40 <SEP> buying a home can be nerve wracking but in the end it's worth it!
40 <SEP> i cant actually see what you put in the prompt, but man thats crazy if it was a ferrari.
40 <SEP> but if you think he won't like the typical drunken debauchery stripper party, don't do it just because it's the thing everyone does.
40 <SEP> i'd be walking if i did.
40 <SEP> but i think they do it more because they think they are protecting us.
40 <SEP> i saw it, and it was a good  movie, i dont usually watch marvel films
40 <SEP> i have always had hp.
40 <SEP> i love the caribbean but i have never been to barbados.
40 <SEP> you were very lucky to go there.
40 <SEP> i did not know they still made those.
40 <SEP> well there ya go, i didn't know.
40 <SEP> i was in sturgis in 2004.
40 <SEP> i didn't know they still toured.
40 <SEP> growing up my parents were neither wealthy nor very poor, but i feel like i had a great childhood.
40 <SEP> my experience wasn't that great, but i still had good times back then.
40 <SEP> no idear who that is but im sure you liked it
40 <SEP> it seems you were anticipating for a long time.
40 <SEP> which movie did you watch/
40 <SEP> you were suppose to start the conversation with a situation based on the context chosen.
40 <SEP> oh when does it come out .. we just got mario aces.. it was ok
40 <SEP> those butterflies are good for you.
40 <SEP> i'm a little farther south, but i do like them for sure.
40 <SEP> i keep saying i want to go but never do.
40 <SEP> ill bet it was!
40 <SEP> yea tell me about it... im still paying off cc's from when my wife and i were dating :p
40 <SEP> i heard it's suppose to be good, more modern but like the classic also!
40 <SEP> a raise you didn't even expect!
40 <SEP> i had the first iphone and wasn't impressed so i never tried again.
40 <SEP> only ones i enjoyed was mw1, mw2, and bo1.
40 <SEP> i actually did buy that one on steam but it barely has any players :(
40 <SEP> it was a long time ago.
40 <SEP> i'm very much against animal cruelty but not every circus is bad thankfully.
40 <SEP> oh man truer words were never spoken!
40 <SEP> i have never had any either.
40 <SEP> i've never been to colorado but i hear great things!
40 <SEP> something i found which helped me lots was to eat e.g.
40 <SEP> i'm not actually much of a soccer fan but the hype is hard to escape!
40 <SEP> that's how many cups of coffee i had this morning!
40 <SEP> but surely not for work !
40 <SEP> i was born in savannah!
40 <SEP> usually mondays suck but not for you!
40 <SEP> i haven't had any in a while, but now i suddenly want some!
40 <SEP> that's such a waste of money and food.
40 <SEP> weekdays always seem to pass so slowly, but weekends fly by not even noticing them
40 <SEP> ive had alot of gay friends.
40 <SEP> i was only 18 when my daughter was born, had no idea what i was  getting into!!
40 <SEP> i actually had some move in a couple of days ago.
40 <SEP> i've had a lot of friends go there.
40 <SEP> i played a lot of video games when i was kid.
40 <SEP> ive heard a lot of good things about austin, but ive never been.
40 <SEP> having a job is a big deal - and i'm sure it was a blessing after not having one for three years!!
40 <SEP> i have never seen that show but i have heard of it.
40 <SEP> despite knowing that i did well.
40 <SEP> ah, well im sure they had a wonderful time.
40 <SEP> but sometimes that can be worth it in terms of the health benefits and lifestyle improvements that come along with it.
40 <SEP> mine isnt quite school aged yet but i was just saying today i cant wait.
40 <SEP> not many 18 year olds can say they did that
40 <SEP> it is good you were patient too for him to pay back
40 <SEP> no, i never had.
40 <SEP> carbs are great when you haven't had them in a while.
40 <SEP> i've been a few tiomes but only for work so never seen the sights.
40 <SEP> i didn't know they were recreating that game!
40 <SEP> but i felt like the trailer had a few dumb lines it, even though i love tom hardy.
40 <SEP> it was in the 90's today.
40 <SEP> i haven't but i am familiar with it.
40 <SEP> i have watched them before but never played.
40 <SEP> i just did last week actually
40 <SEP> my granddaughter had a couple of parties.
40 <SEP> if it were me, it'd be torture trying to figure out what to do.
40 <SEP> i've tried some of the cheaper virtual reality headsets, but i'm sure they can't compare at all!
40 <SEP> never knew you had room mates
40 <SEP> i do but both are in heaven.
40 <SEP> but they are still my children..doctors/midwive mistakes on me (in a lawsuit) and so it affected the second one.
40 <SEP> i thought that i had missed the opportunity.
40 <SEP> my husband is lucky in the lottery, but i'm not.
40 <SEP> you did!
40 <SEP> i didn't know such places existed.
40 <SEP> that was harsh lol
40 <SEP> i took my kids to the beach and now every time we leave the house they ask if that's where we are going.
40 <SEP> my family was the same way, and i still remember coming home after my last day of 6th grade and seeing that same snes box sitting on my bed.
40 <SEP> i don't know what it is, but those "buy in bulk" stores' food cafes always have insane pizza.
40 <SEP> my stepmom used to take me and my brother there when we were younger.
40 <SEP> ah, so not just a little town festival - ya'll did it big!!
40 <SEP> i had that nothing good come easily
40 <SEP> i did the sae thing this year i took my daughter to see my favorite band.
40 <SEP> she had a good time.
40 <SEP> i love to tan and haven't had the chance to yet either!
40 <SEP> i am not someone who likes that but i
40 <SEP> i don't know if you're familiar with the internet term, but on my 30th birthday, i'm going to be a "wizard" lol.
40 <SEP> i did see that
40 <SEP> i have been slacking but thats only because i moved, i have to start back up
40 <SEP> it's just like having to stare at christmas gifts for a month but not being able to open them as a kid.
40 <SEP> it was very tense.
40 <SEP> the other game with england and sweden was not nearly as nerve-wracking.
40 <SEP> lol , i think my son has done that , he use to embrasse me when i would go to the store when he was little by crying a lot
40 <SEP> you sure did
40 <SEP> excellent that it was a great value
40 <SEP> but that's wonderful to hear!
40 <SEP> oh, i didn't mean anything about the age!
40 <SEP> i have never been there, but heard a it's beautiful.
40 <SEP> i remember also playing games with old and slow computers when i was a teenager.
40 <SEP> was your pregnancy planned
40 <SEP> never heard of it but you better believe i will be googling.
40 <SEP> i'm eating some pepperoni pizza as i'm typing this.. washing it down with some beer, my kind of tuesday night
40 <SEP> i thought i had seen every episode of lock down.
40 <SEP> if only they had told us sooner.
40 <SEP> i didn't know such a thing existed!
40 <SEP> summer is great and all but i miss my classmates and the work i'm studying.
40 <SEP> i did.
40 <SEP> i do use their toothpaste, but it was just an instant win contest online.
40 <SEP> it was years ago.
40 <SEP> my youngest is 3, and almost completely potty trained, but its been a struggle.
40 <SEP> her sisters were a 8 and 9 when she was born.
40 <SEP> but i get to work all weekend.
40 <SEP> i don't know much about video games but remember playing mario and games on a nintendo 64.
40 <SEP> i am sure you were strong!
40 <SEP> it was all worth it in the end.
40 <SEP> the n64 was a huge step up for enjoying your alone time for me.
40 <SEP> those are big steps, but if ever there is a good-sign of a relationship, it's when those topics are approached happily.
40 <SEP> i've never had the chance to go to one.
40 <SEP> that is so great that he was able to go.
40 <SEP> i had the same problem as you, but i started at community college when i was 26 and finished at a 4 year college when i was 32.
40 <SEP> i think it is good to go later, because you know what you want more and don't waste time and money.
40 <SEP> i do but they wont come visit and i can't afford to go visit
40 <SEP> i've heard great things about reddit but have never actually signed up myself!
40 <SEP> but yay for you being able to leave that situation!
40 <SEP> i just wish we had taken more time to spend together in his final years.
40 <SEP> ohhhh so you already had her!
40 <SEP> was it your first.
40 <SEP> but it's good to have people who like theirs
40 <SEP> if i didn't have self control i would be like 800 pounds from it.
40 <SEP> i can imagine it was a great experience, not sure if i will ever have kids.
40 <SEP> i was thinking of joining just for that.
40 <SEP> i have a daughter but she isn't married (yet).
40 <SEP> i wants had a smoothie that was terrible there
40 <SEP> we have a cat too but he stays outside on the farm.
40 <SEP> it was a raffle!
40 <SEP> so was i.
40 <SEP> i've found a couple of dollars and lighters in the washing machine.
40 <SEP> my favorite game was zelda by the way
40 <SEP> but good lovin' can be a bill.. if you know what i mean.
40 <SEP> i am sure it was well-deserved.
40 <SEP> but i think you need to have a certain amount of people in your family for it to be worth the membership.
40 <SEP> i just had some myself today, love sushi
40 <SEP> i have always been very close with my family too, but i have friends who aren't and it's horrible
40 <SEP> it was a dump, but it was my dump.
40 <SEP> i hear you, i love them but i get sick when i eat them.
40 <SEP> i do hope you rubbed it into your co-workers' faces like i did!
40 <SEP> i won't have a switch but, i think that may be worth checking out.
40 <SEP> i apologize i thought we were discussing winter coming soon
40 <SEP> makes it even better that you didn't know you were getting it.
40 <SEP> i would do the same if i had something special like that
40 <SEP> you did the right thing.
40 <SEP> i love the one dollar slots, but i always loose everything
40 <SEP> but i have to say, i'm impressed that you were that self-aware about the entire process, especially as a somewhat new adult.
40 <SEP> good for you for considering all the options and making the choice you felt was best.
40 <SEP> i was 17 when i first moved out.
40 <SEP> but i had to have a lot of faith in myself
40 <SEP> but you are write - children are expensive!
40 <SEP> that's an odd day to be paid, but good for you!
40 <SEP> you finally did it.
40 <SEP> i would feel guilty keeping money that i did not earn or that was not mine.
40 <SEP> i never won, but i got close!
40 <SEP> but it will be a good one.
40 <SEP> but she wouldn't be there if you didn't persistently push her to do her best
40 <SEP> i enjoy football, but i mainly enjoy that when football happens, fall comes.
40 <SEP> its was so relaxing.
40 <SEP> i bet you guys had a lot of catching up to do!
40 <SEP> i imagine it was very complicated for you when you did not have a job, that happened to me once and i felt very distressed.
40 <SEP> it was beautiful!
40 <SEP> i'm sure you had a good time!
40 <SEP> i actually got a vacuum myself but made a bad decision.
40 <SEP> i was there many, many years ago.
40 <SEP> i didnt i was busy at work.
40 <SEP> i had some hot dogs and baked beans
40 <SEP> i've been thinking a lot about when i was a kid recently.
40 <SEP> but at least we're comfortable doin it.
40 <SEP> i'm the kind of person that can be around for people a little bit, but get drained by them.
40 <SEP> i was very fortunate.
40 <SEP> no wonder it was lovely.
40 <SEP> sometimes i feel the same as you ... but i get up and move on
40 <SEP> i want a 75 inch but i'm settling at 55 for now lol
40 <SEP> i wish i had the time for that!
40 <SEP> i'm not celiac, but i just eat whole food plant based.
40 <SEP> i love cats, but i'm allergic to them so we can't have any.
40 <SEP> i was an iron chef at ramen cooking back in the day
40 <SEP> i didn't think that was possible for a dog on a walk!
40 <SEP> i wish i was that content with my life.
40 <SEP> it's been a long time since i haven't had sour patch.
40 <SEP> i used to have it, when i was a kid.
40 <SEP> still over my head, but you did a decent job of explaining it in layman's terms.
40 <SEP> you are at a place that we all should be able to be but for many reasons can not.
40 <SEP> i wish i had your drive.
40 <SEP> was it delicious.
40 <SEP> i struggled with physics a lot, but not as much as chemistry.
40 <SEP> you deserve the rest after this week, must be a great feeling to accomplish what you did
40 <SEP> i mean, working from home is great, but doing it on your own time is way better.
40 <SEP> i've had trouble with changing my diet before.
40 <SEP> so when we were growing up, we just never went.
40 <SEP> both times, they were just okay.
40 <SEP> my weekend was pretty okay.
40 <SEP> the first job out of college is a good way to test the waters but someday you will have to spread those wings.
40 <SEP> i am tired too i had to be up early today.
40 <SEP> i wish i had one of those.
40 <SEP> i was hoping for an easier way, but i guess like all worthwhile things hard work is key
40 <SEP> that was also very kind of you husband to do.
40 <SEP> aw, well it's good that you guys took him in.
40 <SEP> in hard times it is easy to distace ourselves from god, but i believe it is important to press in and cast our cares on him.
40 <SEP> but you know, if you have some time off might be a good chance to do cleaning 'round the house too.
40 <SEP> this week was my first week of school so i'm relaxing too now that its friday!
40 <SEP> but for now.. we can finally relax because it's the weekend!
40 <SEP> i am fan but i never read the book.
40 <SEP> i have a rescue that was abused but she was real young.
40 <SEP> so much winning, but with coffee it never gets old
40 <SEP> that was generous of him.
40 <SEP> but continue to work on your punctuality.
40 <SEP> i think i would feel the same way, except i was dumb in my 20s and still have student debt!
40 <SEP> was it a quick flu
40 <SEP> you did things right.
40 <SEP> it was always clean with quick service.
40 <SEP> the workers were always very friendly also.
40 <SEP> i'm sure it took a lot of hard work to get to that point!
40 <SEP> i have not eaten there since i was young and lived in texas.
40 <SEP> i dont jog, i work out but running isnt my thing.
40 <SEP> i actually attempted a diet about a month ago, and it was miserable.
40 <SEP> more recently when i was separated from my current wife.
40 <SEP> i had plans today, but they got canceled.
40 <SEP> i wasn't too upset haha
40 <SEP> i love to play video games, but it's usually with friends.
40 <SEP> i've never had korean food.
40 <SEP> and nothing but student loans to look forward to.
40 <SEP> i have had great success doing keto and fasting for not feeling so hungry!
40 <SEP> i had a cousin living with me for a while until he got on his feet.
40 <SEP> probably just forgot and was embarrassed
40 <SEP> well be gentle but firm.
40 <SEP> it could be that but some of my friends have said that with social media and online dating, it's harder and harder to truly connect with someone.
40 <SEP> my dogs love the outdoors but they want ac after a good, long walk!
40 <SEP> relieved because there isn't drama, but get a bit lonely.
40 <SEP> but, still, never hurts to at least have platonic friends :)
40 <SEP> that's when you know you had a good meal lol
40 <SEP> i am sure you feel better now that you did it.
40 <SEP> i recently had to surrender 1, we had six before.
40 <SEP> but he was being bullied by the others.
40 <SEP> it feels good to be in a new place, but the moving process sucks.
40 <SEP> my family was over all weekend and we had a blast.
40 <SEP> we don't have fancy things or a ton of money but we have each other and our health.
40 <SEP> my previous response was meant to be, "what's your favorite meal", but i accidentally pressed enter.
40 <SEP> not only money, but also emotional
40 <SEP> awww, you're speaking fondly on when he was young.
40 <SEP> hope they had a good day as well.
40 <SEP> we sometimes forget that the elderly were young once and did so much like working, raising and caring for their families.
40 <SEP> but make sure it's a good charity.
40 <SEP> it could be a good explanation but he shouldn't have cursed.
40 <SEP> but once you see that they are just people it makes everything alright
40 <SEP> my mom had a husky named heidi for almost 16 years.
40 <SEP> they are beautiful dogs but boy can they run away fast if they get an opportunity.
40 <SEP> my roommate had a breakup 6 months ago.
40 <SEP> i tried not to give any advice that was too specific, because the best solution always has to come from that person themselves.
40 <SEP> i meant to say that was so sweet of you.
40 <SEP> i'm not quite sure what you are telling me, but handling work and school is certainly hard
40 <SEP> but my family turns a deaf ear.
40 <SEP> i'm pleased that you did not.
40 <SEP> 10 and 13 now, but it never changes.
40 <SEP> i had a dog die in a house fire not long ago and i am just not ready for a dog.
40 <SEP> it's so sweet that you were able to help her.
40 <SEP> accepting .. but not in my case.. you are lucky i guess
40 <SEP> you deserve to be appreciated, but i'm sure they appreciate you a lot.
40 <SEP> you want to comfort them but you don't know what to do/say
40 <SEP> i wish i had such good friends like you do!
40 <SEP> but kids can be a handful when they are sick.
40 <SEP> welll one day they will see you were right
40 <SEP> i had one of those.
40 <SEP> i wish more people would react the way that you did.
40 <SEP> that was so kind of you to take her in.
40 <SEP> i always try to be as good of a mom as my mom was to me.
40 <SEP> i wish i had a grandmother.
40 <SEP> i want to rescue but i have to wait until i move.
40 <SEP> that was very thoughtful, something to keep her entertained when she wasn't feeling well.
40 <SEP> that was so sweet of you to do!
40 <SEP> it's good you were able to find new companionship in your new dog.
40 <SEP> same here but mostly at xmas time
40 <SEP> if you're not familiar with the breed, they resemble jack russell terriers, but they are bred for squirrel hunting.
40 <SEP> we have a little "tent city" in our neighborhood and it was just announced that they're going to be removed.
40 <SEP> my mom did too.
40 <SEP> i sure did.
40 <SEP> my husband and i spent most of the money we had on a honeymoon and then struggled for years doing things the wrong way.
40 <SEP> so...what did you do
40 <SEP> you did your best, and i'm sure he is in heaven now looking over you!
40 <SEP> i didn't know those were real.
40 <SEP> my sister is a cna now but in school to become a nurse.
40 <SEP> i wish i had your job
40 <SEP> i bet you had no problems, dogs are easy to take care of, they blindly accept anything
40 <SEP> i've never volunteered for an animal shelter but i would like to get into it once i have more time on my hands.
40 <SEP> my kids want one of those, but we have to wait until the youngest is old enough.
40 <SEP> my grandma had that and it is devastating to experience it.
40 <SEP> but at least you understand what's happening and are obviously prepared for the inevitable.
40 <SEP> my parents did the same with my grandparents.
40 <SEP> my grandmother was on the heart transplant list for about a month before getting a new heart.
40 <SEP> i don't have a dog right now but i want one.
40 <SEP> i wish i had a friend like you.
40 <SEP> you did a good deed
40 <SEP> i have a cat who just had four kittens.
40 <SEP> you are lucky, and i am sure he will be tons of work but it will be worth it.
40 <SEP> i prefer dogs but i still like cats.
40 <SEP> we kept hoping we would find it's owner so never gave her a name so her name was forever miss kitty.
40 <SEP> i mean she was able to notice a cat in danger and helped out and all.
40 <SEP> but with mammas love everything is alright.
40 <SEP> i have a dog i rescued (she was a stray, not from a shelter)
40 <SEP> i've also got a snake i've had for ~15 years
40 <SEP> they come with hard work have to walk and feed them but you will get back into your groove.
40 <SEP> i lost my wife to cancer years ago and people helping was great.
40 <SEP> even the smallest gestures were meaningful.
40 <SEP> she took care of you when you were little so it only makes sense that you'd want to return the favor.
40 <SEP> i am sure she will be around for whenever you need her like you did last week.
40 <SEP> i also have a dog that was starved when she was young!
40 <SEP> but, also that you most likely won't have long to make a bond, play, etc.
40 <SEP> that's a tough job but so rewarding!
40 <SEP> there are laws here but they find ways around them.
40 <SEP> i wish i had more friends like you.
40 <SEP> he was dirty and i had to bathe him very thoroughly.
40 <SEP> thats good that it wasnt major.
40 <SEP> thats good wish my brother was like that.
40 <SEP> you should've took a picture and framed it so you guys can cherish that moment forever
40 <SEP> she wasn't the right one obviously.
40 <SEP> i like kids but i wouldn't want to work with them all day.
40 <SEP> it's good, but i'm a little nervous for them.
40 <SEP> i wish there would be, but i very much doubt that there will.
40 <SEP> i'm sure it was a great comfort to you.
40 <SEP> my boyfriend once said if he ever had to be in a wheelchair he wanted me to kill him.
40 <SEP> oh man you were drunk!
40 <SEP> never even had it before.
40 <SEP> i wish i had some friends like that in my life
40 <SEP> i wish everyone was that lucky.
40 <SEP> i wish mine did but they're dreading their first day back tomorrow.
40 <SEP> i wish i had that!
40 <SEP> i didn't understand you.
40 <SEP> man that was super lucky, most people would have taken it
40 <SEP> i am sure they did not mind doing that
40 <SEP> well that's wonderful that you had a supporting aunt like that.
40 <SEP> but i do not think gambling is a wise way of putting your hard earned money
40 <SEP> i wish i was in a situation that i could help her more.
40 <SEP> i mean, i don't think i buy more than $30 of groceries at a time since it's just me, but still!
40 <SEP> that was very sweet and thoughtful too.
40 <SEP> it's normal to fight about things as a couple, but i would wait a little longer before you decide to get married :)
40 <SEP> my first work from home was stressful i had to send the kids to daycare.
40 <SEP> i have two wiener dogs, and they are both spoiled brats, but i love them.
40 <SEP> i used to have a giant bag of tools but everything got stolen , what tool was it
40 <SEP> some people would find it annoying that their parents still want to baby them, but i say you shouldn't take it for granted.
40 <SEP> i had one parent like that
40 <SEP> we were in a similar situation last year, but things have started looking up.
40 <SEP> it was.
40 <SEP> that is good that he had an air compressor.
40 <SEP> she said she hopes my daughter acted 10 times worse than i did.
40 <SEP> if that's the case, i need to start saving for boarding school, because i was awful!
40 <SEP> but it's worth it in the end.
40 <SEP> i saved up for 4 months but then had a massive car repair bill..
40 <SEP> i guess, but they can always teach them
40 <SEP> oh that's quite luck and fortunate for you, i've never had a lost wallet returned.
40 <SEP> thanks , and once again thank you for your service in any field contributing to society
40 <SEP> that is so wonderful that you give your parents the credit and are so grateful for what they did for you!
40 <SEP> but then again it is probably not having coffee that causes the headache too.
40 <SEP> i miss when my daughter was that young.
40 <SEP> i didn't have anywhere to go.
40 <SEP> same here for sure but they make gloomy days a lot better.
40 <SEP> my school didn't have anything like that.
40 <SEP> aw :) i wish i had kids.
40 <SEP> yea, they do, but they're getting old.
40 <SEP> i have had that happen to me many times over the last five years.
40 <SEP> that was very lucky!
40 <SEP> seems like if you didn't meet your sweetheart in school, it's more difficult to find a girlfriend.
40 <SEP> i lost my wallet once but didn't find money in it when it was returned to me.
40 <SEP> i wish i didn't have to work :)
40 <SEP> true, though i just wish girls weren't so shallow sometimes.
40 <SEP> even i wanted to learn guitar.. but have no time for it
40 <SEP> my mother is like that too, and it's easy take for granted, but not all are so lucky !
40 <SEP> that can be very unhealthy for you but it's so convenient
40 <SEP> if only more bosses were like that, the workforce would be a lot happier and productive i think.
40 <SEP> its hard work, but so worth it
40 <SEP> no i've never had to deal with that before.
40 <SEP> i was just dog-sitting my neighbor's dogs last week.
40 <SEP> they felt like my little sisters i had to take care of and play with
40 <SEP> i can relate i like to keep work at work but as an adult you spend so much time at work it's hard to meet people other places.
40 <SEP> i was thinking it was new york where the cabbies are notorious for being rude.
40 <SEP> ah, so he had ulterior motives and wanted the chores done!
40 <SEP> but, we just got to keep working.
40 <SEP> mine broke too this past weekend but i got a new one as it was just a cheap dirt devil.
40 <SEP> i always had communication problems with my parents
40 <SEP> i bet it did.
40 <SEP> if we had a better public transportation system where i live, i'd probably choose that over cars.
40 <SEP> i wish i was that close with my family.
40 <SEP> i did!
40 <SEP> it was awful!
40 <SEP> some food pantries are amazing but some have just crappy sugary foods.
40 <SEP> i have 2 kids and they were a handful as toddlers.
40 <SEP> that's a bummer, at least it didn't go out in the beginning of summer, i guess.
40 <SEP> you werent able to walk into an office and get it faster
40 <SEP> good thing they were willing to help
40 <SEP> well atleast he did what he could to show you he cares.
40 <SEP> i'm sure you were, money is good to have.
40 <SEP> so many fronting to donate, but they're actually stealing.
40 <SEP> i was always thankful for them.
40 <SEP> i get that, but things are still better for those around you, so it feels bad still
40 <SEP> i get that, but things are still better for those around you, so it feels bad still
40 <SEP> i've had those experiences as well.
40 <SEP> that was sweet.
40 <SEP> good thing is you had an alternative.
40 <SEP> it was in the 90's today
40 <SEP> if it was the bank's mistake, even if you didn't have enough money, they're responsible for fixing it.
40 <SEP> sometimes it's kind of hard to save up money but it's good to have something saved up when things get bad
40 <SEP> i had horrible roomates.
40 <SEP> i was in a car wreck once.
40 <SEP> i have tried saving like that, but i always end up spending it.
40 <SEP> i was raised in a presbyterian church in scotland, but haven't been to church in a while.
40 <SEP> i wish i were so content.
40 <SEP> well, at least your friend was there to help you out.
40 <SEP> i wish i had one like that
40 <SEP> but at least your husband is there to assist when in need.
40 <SEP> that was very kind of her.
40 <SEP> i figured it was for work or something when you said two months.
40 <SEP> i would be extra careful if i was driving someone else's car...especially benz!
40 <SEP> or did he completely mess up your car hah
40 <SEP> i have been in that place, where i needed help, and was incredibly grateful to those who helped.
40 <SEP> i've been married for 5 years and i can't imagine being with anyone else but my wife
40 <SEP> it's wonderful you had someone like your mother to help!
40 <SEP> i lent my car to a friend for a week and thank goodness everything was alright.
40 <SEP> that was very generous of you
40 <SEP> elvis only had a daugther, so the chances of him telling the true are slim
40 <SEP> great, i bet he did a good job
40 <SEP> that's understandable, but you won't know her position on the issue until you bring it up.
40 <SEP> well if he was good at the trick its understandable.
40 <SEP> as long as you were a kid.
40 <SEP> i use to go to church when i was little.
40 <SEP> i had a very close relationship with my sister too.
40 <SEP> my sister was mine too.
40 <SEP> he is so much happier without this girl he was dating.
40 <SEP> she was alot!
40 <SEP> that was very kind of you.
40 <SEP> but at least you can trust your wife and kids!
40 <SEP> i envy you, wish i was there to have some with a cup of coffee
40 <SEP> even if you don't get rewarded immediately but at least you helped someone.
40 <SEP> i feel the same about my husband but you hear so many horror stories you can't help but be a little weary
40 <SEP> i'm well mostly, but ready for fall to come.
40 <SEP> i wish i had that kind of relationship.
40 <SEP> i guess your not as lucky as i was first initially thinking.
40 <SEP> i can see some of the reasons why a person would think that -- but it's still difficult when it comes to the health of someone you love.
40 <SEP> i wish i was a good driver!
40 <SEP> but we've been married for 5 years now and still crazy about each other
40 <SEP> i am also starting a new venture and it is taking a lot of time and hard work but i think it is finally paying off soon.
40 <SEP> that's probably true, but who knows in this country.
40 <SEP> i think he will be out, but apparently his approval rating has gone up.
40 <SEP> i used to want to do that so bad when i was younger.
40 <SEP> i can not stand when people do shady things like that.
40 <SEP> oooh no  thats was so bad
40 <SEP> my lease was coming up and i needed a deposit for a new apartment and my friend was able to help me out.
40 <SEP> haha, that wasn't very wise.
40 <SEP> i'm sure she will be okay but i would be so nervus
40 <SEP> i've had a similar experience with a gossiping coworker.
40 <SEP> that's completely reasonable considering the distance you had to drive for no reason.
40 <SEP> that was smart to get a used one.
40 <SEP> but i didn't want to say no.
40 <SEP> so, i was a little wary of that.
40 <SEP> that's terrible, hope you weren't counting on it for fincancial reasons
40 <SEP> it's okay to trust, but always be cautious too.
40 <SEP> uau, that was a close call indeed.
40 <SEP> i lent my credit card to my sister one time and it did not go well.
40 <SEP> yep, i just feel it was a simpler time back then.
40 <SEP> i have had problems with that as well.
40 <SEP> i wish i had some advice to give.
40 <SEP> they were clearly not your friends.
40 <SEP> i had a horrible experience the one time i used a hired babysitter and now i only leave my little ones with family.
40 <SEP> i had braces growing up too, the worst part for me was the molding!
40 <SEP> i wish i had more of that type of friends
40 <SEP> i think i would like to move eventually, but for now i'm barely learning how to be independent, i started abusing drugs at age 14, now 15 years later im barely starting to "grow up" almost a year sober now.
40 <SEP> that was a very generous gesture on your part.
40 <SEP> i wish my brothers did that for me.
40 <SEP> okay, but probably not a good idea in the long run.
40 <SEP> i'm tired but otherwise great.
40 <SEP> you didn't know he was down on his luck, but out of the goodness of your heart, you gave him money regardless.
40 <SEP> but i have little spending money, so i always have to turn them down
40 <SEP> i wish my mom was still alive.
40 <SEP> even though you were upset because you had to work look at the bright side.
40 <SEP> at least they did that much for you.
40 <SEP> hope you did not find yourself in the bad part of town
40 <SEP> it could take awhile but im sure he will make enough to pay you back.
40 <SEP> dating is one of those things that everyone makes seem so easy, but in reality it's just so difficult to be able to open up to people sometimes.
40 <SEP> i thought your brothers dog wasn't to be trusted.
40 <SEP> no crash, i was lucky to get out of the way.
40 <SEP> i was pretty shacky afterwards though.
40 <SEP> no i don't know my neighbor that well but my best friend lives close so she has my spare key
40 <SEP> onc or twice but i try not too often,
40 <SEP> thank goodness they didn't break.
40 <SEP> im sure the owner was very appreciative!
40 <SEP> if i lost mine hiking i would for sure think it was gone forever.
40 <SEP> and... im guessing they didnt.
40 <SEP> especially rock climbing - i had a friend who made me do it once too
40 <SEP> i guess it was a lifetime opportunity too.
40 <SEP> i'm sure it was an amazing experience!
40 <SEP> i wish someone in my family was so handy!
40 <SEP> i feel so bad you had to go through that.
40 <SEP> i wish i had people like that to work with
40 <SEP> dang, i guess she wasn't your friend after all
40 <SEP> it was her who initiated the first move for us to split our ways.
40 <SEP> good, my son could be driving, but he doesn't have a car to drive or the real need to.
40 <SEP> that's good :) but you are the wiser for it
40 <SEP> it was his decision to cheat.
40 <SEP> more teachers would succeed if that was available to them.
40 <SEP> it's alot of work but it's rewarding
40 <SEP> i am a male so it was hard at first to do that since most girls do want some assertive guys.
40 <SEP> i wish i did too!
40 <SEP> i had the same affinity for swimming.
40 <SEP> at first i didn't want to but as i got better i started to love it.
40 <SEP> i'm sure you did great!
40 <SEP> well it over now and i'm sure you did great!
40 <SEP> well i just bought a great bathing suit that covers up all the extras but still shows a little skin and makes me feel good.
40 <SEP> seems like you were aware of it
40 <SEP> try to be confident but not overly entitled.
40 <SEP> i did that a couple of summers ago..
40 <SEP> after the interview was over i though it went very well.
40 <SEP> thats good to know because i had no idea.
40 <SEP> five is a great number, but six is even better.
40 <SEP> that's perfect then, i'm sure you did a great job@
40 <SEP> i always had trouble with math so anything above counting is beyond what i feel competent in.
40 <SEP> you'll be great, i wish i was there to see it
40 <SEP> well i don't know how wonderful you are, but you sure are narcissistic, which isn't a good trade to have, people are all equal there is no difference in us
40 <SEP> unfortunately i don't but i have a brother who loves to play it.
40 <SEP> i bet it did
40 <SEP> oh that is good that you had the time
40 <SEP> i always had a hard time remembering the dates and times especially.
40 <SEP> i'm sure you did great.
40 <SEP> but it is much easier than learning to cook myself.
40 <SEP> that's interesting, i'm not sure i even knew there were different types of caffeine.
40 <SEP> but even if it doesn't turn out, keep on searching.
40 <SEP> you did good!
40 <SEP> that's good news did you already take the written portion
40 <SEP> it seem that you were weel prepared.
40 <SEP> no, we had to fight through a lot of stuff.
40 <SEP> and if so how did you find it
40 <SEP> i use to run track in high school and was active duty army so running has always been a big part of my life.
40 <SEP> i like boats, but i don't think i would be a good rower.
40 <SEP> i am sure they benefited from your coaching even if they didn't win in the playoffs.
40 <SEP> that is well worth taking a chance on since the risk of rejection did not happen and the payoff was a good outcome.
40 <SEP> i am sure that you did great!
40 <SEP> it was a bit overwhelming getting back into the state of mind required for school, but it is all worth it!
40 <SEP> i kind of had my eye on a career like that when i was in school, but ultimately didn't go that route.
40 <SEP> right, you always see the before and after pictures of other people but as you're doing it, it seems to take forever
40 <SEP> i like poker, but better at blackjack.
40 <SEP> but, not on your level by any means!
40 <SEP> you should give yourself more credit and not say you were lucky!
40 <SEP> i was nervous for no reason
40 <SEP> but don't get too overconfident!
40 <SEP> but i find it hard to actually motivate myself.
40 <SEP> being a mom can be hard, but it is so rewarding.
40 <SEP> i don't know about you, but i have been stressed out about the whole process.
40 <SEP> something i wish i had as kid
40 <SEP> that is a challenge, but thats not a bad thing
40 <SEP> i was never very good at math in school.
40 <SEP> i didn't have a lot of easy classes when i was in college
40 <SEP> and how did you learn about him
40 <SEP> it great you were confident despite your illness.
40 <SEP> hope you did well and everything went smoothly!
40 <SEP> i bet you did and i'm sure you got the job
40 <SEP> i trust you did well too
40 <SEP> if you were given the project, it's probably because someone thinks you can do it!
40 <SEP> i usually feel better when i exercise, but i've been putting it off.
40 <SEP> the last one i played was called "car wars" and it was at a new year's party.
40 <SEP> i would like to do the same, but it is very expensive where i live.
40 <SEP> i never took the act
40 <SEP> i took the act.
40 <SEP> you know something worker_1, everytime you feel good about something, it always means that you did good!
40 <SEP> i wish i had your motivation for...well...everything else in life.
40 <SEP> my husband had an interview as well.
40 <SEP> my husband was so nervous but he thinks it went well
40 <SEP> i didn't understand.
40 <SEP> seems like you took all the precautions, the rest is not up to you.
40 <SEP> you should have placed a bet since you were so confident.
40 <SEP> they didnt wanna to see the slaughter anymore.
40 <SEP> i wish i had that kind of will power
40 <SEP> that was the right move!
40 <SEP> not that long to wait, but better be careful in the meantime so you won't be left somewhere far from help.
40 <SEP> seems simple, but nobody does it that way it seems like.
40 <SEP> i can see why it was hard to quit!
40 <SEP> well, it is a good thing you had so much faith in your father.
40 <SEP> it is good you had someone so reliable in your life.
40 <SEP> i have believed myself a ruler of the world but still live in this box.
40 <SEP> we were stuck on space mountain once.
40 <SEP> hope everything was backed up.
40 <SEP> well at least you were able to introduce him to your friend.
40 <SEP> it had great responsiveness, was speeding like a mofo
40 <SEP> i'll bet you were.
40 <SEP> that must be hard sometimes, but i guess also has its advantages.
40 <SEP> nothing like it did in the past.
40 <SEP> i have not seen the message about the incident but i do hope that person will speak to you.
40 <SEP> that was the right thing to do.
40 <SEP> i can't help but be a little jealous.
40 <SEP> we all have thinking that sometimes, but acting is the wrong thing to do.
40 <SEP> or it could be they are ready to move on but need to know someone else will be interested in them.
40 <SEP> i wish things were better!
40 <SEP> its not about cheating... you can love someone but if they don't meet certain needs, not just sexual... you can get it elsewhere but that doesnt negate your love for the person who is unable to fulfill your needs
40 <SEP> makes me kind of miss the old days when people had a real sense of community.
40 <SEP> i never did a long distance one.
40 <SEP> but my brother did, and it was about 400 miles.
40 <SEP> she was a keeper though, i'm sure it was worth it for him.
40 <SEP> that is a good thing to do, im sure you feel empowered because of that
40 <SEP> well that's good that yo didnt do it
40 <SEP> my mom was bipolar
40 <SEP> but i would less satisfied
40 <SEP> i wish i had more friends like you.
40 <SEP> i too have had the same issues.
40 <SEP> it is, but we can learn from them and not do the same thing.
40 <SEP> aww, that's terrible but good she has you.
40 <SEP> i have had many family members that had that fight.
40 <SEP> some would consider it cheating if you did not tell them.
40 <SEP> not anymore, but it is so great to hear that it is possible to find happiness!
40 <SEP> that's when you say politely, i'll take the drink but not your number.
40 <SEP> it was good habit i like it
40 <SEP> i never got into cod and i tried overwatch when it first came out but i wasn't very good.
40 <SEP> nooo,  the first time i took it,  i misbehaved
40 <SEP> my parents weren't either.
40 <SEP> i wish i had a expedition
40 <SEP> i recently got married, but we have been together for 12 years and are always there for one another.
40 <SEP> i mean did they reward your 25 years of service at your job by giving you a present or throwing you a party.
40 <SEP> i luckily have not had anyone cheat on me.
40 <SEP> but if you feel your current one is lacking something, and your eye is wandering, you owe it to yourself and your current boyfriend to reflect on why that is, and if there can be improvements, or if you should both move on.
40 <SEP> but it seems like a lot of politicians either don't care or are not putting enough resources into combating climate change.
40 <SEP> i have always had a great church family.
40 <SEP> my aunt's church was pivotal in showing me how to be the best i could be and developing my character.
40 <SEP> oh, that was wonderful of you!
40 <SEP> you did the right thing!
40 <SEP> i have lost things before and never had anyone turn them in and its not a good feeling.
40 <SEP> i never did go to a preacher.
40 <SEP> i have trouble letting the petty things go but i think i'll learn to be better as time goes by.
40 <SEP> i don't know how rare it is but in the 14 years i've been married we've seen a lot of other couples suffer with infidelity.
40 <SEP> i can't afford all of them, but i have several.
40 <SEP> i haven't got that one yet, but once i have a bit of spare cash i'll look into it.
40 <SEP> you didn't let anything affect the friendship!
40 <SEP> we lose touch but we will always be great friends.
40 <SEP> cheating after 10 years would truly make you a terrible person to waste someone elses life for 10 years only to go through such a betrayal.
40 <SEP> but it must be great food if you keep going back
40 <SEP> i wonder if he was trying to prove something.
40 <SEP> well, at least you weren't left there for all eternity.
40 <SEP> that is incredible , my dad had canswer and we had people from our church pray for him and others did as well and his cancer went into remission.
40 <SEP> i remember in highschool we had a biology teacher and the kids kept badgering him about if he had a wife.
40 <SEP> he's taking on quite a lot, but it'll be good for building his character as he gets older!
40 <SEP> was he better than cris angel
40 <SEP> i had an experience similar to that as well.
40 <SEP> he was fighting for his life.
40 <SEP> that's impressive but, 45 mags are rare.
40 <SEP> i heard the circus had to close recently.
40 <SEP> my mother was also a beauty contest winner when she was 18.
40 <SEP> i don't know how anyone could turn an abused child away..it's not easy but they need help.
40 <SEP> i always had androids before, but i do like iphone a bit better too!
40 <SEP> trick for me was to memorize my speaches and tune out while giving them.
40 <SEP> i've never tried that but it looks pretty good.
40 <SEP> last flat i had was on a gravel road in the middle of nowhere,lol.
40 <SEP> my cell was out of range and it was dark out.
40 <SEP> i always wanted to be able to do that, but i was never any good
40 <SEP> i used to live in miami and that was a big deal when he was part of the white hot heat
40 <SEP> you will be able to say you saw him before he was famous!
40 <SEP> if i took time though i could probably learn how to
40 <SEP> everyone knew he was going to do it though
40 <SEP> oh, it's great that he scored good grade though he didn't study well.
40 <SEP> he was the face of cleveland.
40 <SEP> i bet he did lol!
40 <SEP> of course you were
40 <SEP> thats to be expected but you seem like a caring person
40 <SEP> my mom had three boys, so i'll be lucky to have a daughter.
40 <SEP> it was more shared with the whole family.
40 <SEP> but later my dad hired a maid.
40 <SEP> i read online on 4chan that da vinci was likely an alien from the future.
40 <SEP> it's good to hear they were good live, that can't be said about every group.
40 <SEP> i never feel like i have enough money to hand out, but there's many people worse off than me who could use it.
40 <SEP> i wasnt good.
40 <SEP> oh i was thinking of his son.
40 <SEP> but these are very little chances to count on and hope for
40 <SEP> but do not count on such things happening in life.
40 <SEP> 10th grade was a good year.
40 <SEP> it sure was.
40 <SEP> i think there are a lot more choices now than there was years ago
40 <SEP> i am not sure it was
40 <SEP> then you get to the bowling alley, try to do what they do, end up getting 3 gutter balls in a row, and fall flat on your butt to boot!
40 <SEP> seems incredible but also kind of boring at the same time.
40 <SEP> i didnt either!
40 <SEP> i saw his initial performance and was blown away!
40 <SEP> i have tried juggling 3 small objects before and felt like it was impossible.
40 <SEP> i bet they had to be carried back home.
40 <SEP> i've had it and it's not bad.
40 <SEP> i didn't graduate until i was 40 something
40 <SEP> it was many years of work.
40 <SEP> i have a mom to talk too, so it helps but loads of trauma, abuse and death are hard to even talk about.
40 <SEP> i have had to talk to customers who were nasty to clerks before!
40 <SEP> mine took months to train forever.
40 <SEP> someone was recording him from the shadows
40 <SEP> i have never had it.
40 <SEP> well he sure did save a lot in labor costs.
40 <SEP> i've been enjoying them too, but not quite as much as the originals.
40 <SEP> but, he's got little to do with it at this point.
40 <SEP> that must be very hard for you all, but i'm sure it will be worth it in the end.
40 <SEP> i just recenlt had a baby.
40 <SEP> it was amazing!
40 <SEP> was he using a loop station and a backing track or what
40 <SEP> i do too, tn, but i can't think of a soul food place here.
40 <SEP> luckily the phone didn't fall and crack the glass!
40 <SEP> i worked my butt off trying to get in shape at mine.
40 <SEP> that was sweet
40 <SEP> i didn't have my first sleepover til i was 6.
40 <SEP> bet he was digesting for days!
40 <SEP> was it a special occasion, or did you guys just want to enjoy yourselves just for the heck of it
40 <SEP> was he apart of a show
40 <SEP> i'm a stay at home mom and honestly it's the hardest job i've ever had but the most rewarding one :) i told my husband i want to keep having kids so i won't have to work again lol
40 <SEP> i had never visited there.
40 <SEP> but it reminds me of athenas and that old cities
40 <SEP> i used to be pretty athletic, but now i take in most sports from the comfort of my sofa!
40 <SEP> i wish i had that level of willpower to even lose a couple of pounds from my hanging waist fat
40 <SEP> that was brave of her
40 <SEP> you are crazy, ha ha - i probably would have had a panic attack at 90mph.
40 <SEP> i was love kids
40 <SEP> yea but at least now you have found a good, trustworthy place.
40 <SEP> hope you had a good time!
40 <SEP> i am sure it was excellent and not raw!
40 <SEP> my favorite team used to the bruins, but then i moved
40 <SEP> i was as well.
40 <SEP> but i'm rooting for them anyway.
40 <SEP> thats one of my biggest regrets was not investing in it.
40 <SEP> i didnt know that.
40 <SEP> but don't forget that the yankees are super good
40 <SEP> neither do i, but there are impressive museums out there that kinda make you change your stance.
40 <SEP> but that means you can ride with him that much sooner.
40 <SEP> that was sweet of him!
40 <SEP> ha i took a shot in the dark.
40 <SEP> i try to breastfeed but usually can't do that for more than 6 months so i'm hoping i can keep my milk supply up longer.
40 <SEP> it was pretty crazy!
40 <SEP> that childhood magic was the best.
40 <SEP> well hope you didn't have flashbacks of it too often.
40 <SEP> it was a go9d manner i loved it.
40 <SEP> you truly did it.
40 <SEP> so all that time you were just feeling your dog licking you!
40 <SEP> he is my pet.. i have had him 10 years.. he is about 70lbs now.. got two more little ones inside
40 <SEP> you seem like a positive person who can contribute well.
40 <SEP> that was very thoughtful or her.
40 <SEP> damn, i wish i had a car myself.
40 <SEP> you should tell her that if you didn't already.
40 <SEP> you did good.
40 <SEP> i haven't won on a ticket in a long time, but i once one $300!!
40 <SEP> i spent mine on paying off a credit card in part, which is boring but lead to more money in the long run.
40 <SEP> im straight but the way my dad raised me , he said to respect all sexes , and what ever religion i choose was up to me , i have never gone to church
40 <SEP> i used to do that when i was in college with my family.
40 <SEP> i have and it didn't go so well for me.
40 <SEP> woo,i wish i was there,congrats
40 <SEP> that was kind of herr
40 <SEP> i didn't think about that.
40 <SEP> i've never been into got but i've heard it's good.
40 <SEP> she tricked me all day and said she wasn't pregnant.
40 <SEP> life was simple then wasnt it!
40 <SEP> i was single until i was 29.
40 <SEP> i am not a big fan but i go fishing once or twice a year.
40 <SEP> that was a great movie!
40 <SEP> marriages take work but it is totally worth it when you have a good partner.
40 <SEP> my best friend and i moved away so i hadly ever see them now
40 <SEP> i had to buy my first car and it wasn't until i was 21 that i could afford it.
40 <SEP> i would switch to a new one if i could (and all her friends weren't there)
40 <SEP> i had to use a subway once to get to work on time.
40 <SEP> it was ok, but while on the train i lost my phone and somebody returned it to me.
40 <SEP> there were some burds fighting under my car once and i thought it was cats.
40 <SEP> even better honestly then you didnt have to deal with the stress of trying and it just came natural!
40 <SEP> well that was a good choice then!
40 <SEP> i haven't had a chance to try bath bombs yet.
40 <SEP> but my daughter in-law loves them.
40 <SEP> oh i didnt get a chance to see the game
40 <SEP> i had a similar thing where they would have to replace the whole front body for a small scratch.
40 <SEP> i haven't had a slice of that in forever.
40 <SEP> i was devastated i grew up listening to him.
40 <SEP> i loved his song starfish & coffee when i was little.
40 <SEP> many thought that way, but he actually delivered on his promises
40 <SEP> strange the receptionist did that.
40 <SEP> i've never had luck with being unprepared for things, i always choke.
40 <SEP> i also buy used, but most people tend to look down on it
40 <SEP> you had a good idea.
40 <SEP> hope you had a good birthday.
40 <SEP> that is true, marriage is great in a vaccuum, but life pops the bag sometimes
40 <SEP> hope you weren't bit!
40 <SEP> groceries can be expensive, so that was a blessing.
40 <SEP> i've never had anything like that happen.
40 <SEP> i wonder if it was out there having a homeward bound style adventure.
40 <SEP> that was so great of your friend
40 <SEP> damn i can't believe i didn't hear.
40 <SEP> i bet that did some damage to the car.
40 <SEP> i am sure that was quite a delightful experience, especially since you were not expecting to enjoy it.
40 <SEP> you had an invigorating tea, delicious!
40 <SEP> i had a little box turtle when i was younger, i liked her a lot.
40 <SEP> i wish my godmother did that!
40 <SEP> i guess it was just meant to be then
40 <SEP> i thought i was dreaming
40 <SEP> but, sometimes people need others to help take care of them.
40 <SEP> i am sure it was!
40 <SEP> i rescued her from outside after she was attacked by a dog.
40 <SEP> that was thoughtful of them.
40 <SEP> i wish i had such a good co workers!
40 <SEP> but now you have a new pet to live with you
40 <SEP> $300 was way too much for my budget.
40 <SEP> i'm sure you were pretty nervous after you applied.
40 <SEP> i was never a good history student.
40 <SEP> my japanese spitz did that once...lady was waving a bone around and pulling back...til he caught her with one snap and almost bit her finger clean off
40 <SEP> i had that happen when i got one for christmas.
40 <SEP> i have never had that happen to me
40 <SEP> my little brother did the same for me actually.
40 <SEP> thats awful, if i were there and he crossed the line, i would speak to someone above him about it.
40 <SEP> i was in the us when i saw it thought it has been a while since it happened.
40 <SEP> physics is an interesting subject, but it can get difficult to understand sometimes.
40 <SEP> i didn't know that actually
40 <SEP> last time i saw him, he was playing pretty rough so it's neat to hear he's back on track
40 <SEP> thats a lot but she will get good use out of it
40 <SEP> i have in real life friends , and a regular job , but because of back problems and sciatica ive made many friends online i consider to be like brothers social media has let me make relationships while in bed lol
40 <SEP> no, i missed it, but i do usually watch ufc fights!
40 <SEP> i feel like it was been around for a while!
40 <SEP> i guess you got lucky you didn't get robbed or have some animals become new roommates.
40 <SEP> no , but i heard about it in commercials
40 <SEP> i got payed , went shopping ate dinner, then my friend messaged me asking for his money .... i had totally forgot about this
40 <SEP> you should get back to work and kick some butt :)
40 <SEP> i would laugh so hard if that was me seeing my dog do that
40 <SEP> sure is, last time i saw one was some time in the 90s.
40 <SEP> and i thought my $2500 limit was decent!
40 <SEP> i love that they didn't forget about you!
40 <SEP> then he did his job well.
40 <SEP> i wish i had a truck, they're so useful.
40 <SEP> i had to work when i turned 21.
40 <SEP> i went to the casino after and won 250 dollars but i was by myself lol
40 <SEP> i can relate...it was a relief to go on vacation and get away from them.
40 <SEP> it was a dream to get away.
40 <SEP> but at least you went back to her to comfort her.
40 <SEP> but you did and look at you now, miss hottie!
40 <SEP> i had some one tip me a $25 chip at the casino after seeing a pic of my daughter in my locket.
40 <SEP> i had to quit after so many years
40 <SEP> i did not like college much
40 <SEP> i bet it did
40 <SEP> i like sunshine, but know we need some rain too, hope you get some soon.
40 <SEP> i just had a little baby girl 3 weeks ago
40 <SEP> that's so sweet and fortunate that she was able to do that for you.
40 <SEP> marriage is tough but when you love each other it's work the effort.
40 <SEP> that was so generous of them.
40 <SEP> it still had my money in it!
40 <SEP> i wonder who did it.
40 <SEP> that was very kind of them.
40 <SEP> it almost rained on me when i was walking home today.
40 <SEP> that was very thoughtful of them.
40 <SEP> i was robbed in flint.
40 <SEP> i met an old school friend the other day, and they were awful now!
40 <SEP> i bet you had a good time though at your party
40 <SEP> oh my gosh they did get you good.
40 <SEP> they were the favorites all the way.
40 <SEP> i was too!
40 <SEP> i can imagine it was something wonderful.
40 <SEP> i've had 3 bunnies/rabbits in my lifetime and they were great pets.
40 <SEP> my albino rabbit i had when i was younger was like that....skittish beyond belief!
40 <SEP> oh okay what teams were playing
40 <SEP> but i can bear it since i'm saving money.
40 <SEP> we had a couple days at 0f this year.
40 <SEP> i heard about that on the news, how it was rare to see that.
40 <SEP> were you able to make use of all the equipment
40 <SEP> i was hoping he'd come to miami!
40 <SEP> and what was
40 <SEP> i have had way too many close calls on my finals.
40 <SEP> i use emails a lot but i don't feel the need to use actual paper letters.
40 <SEP> at least he was able to make it this time!
40 <SEP> i'll bet it was!
40 <SEP> i guess he didn't care!
40 <SEP> yea thats good they did
40 <SEP> i've never had a party like that myself.
40 <SEP> i had no idea!
40 <SEP> he was probably hungry, and thought to himself, that place wasn't so bad huh.
40 <SEP> i've only been to one nfl game and it was wild!
40 <SEP> i remember finding out i got free tickets to disney world one time, i was ecstatic.
40 <SEP> the only pizza i have ever had at the gas station was some pizza from 7/11.
40 <SEP> so it wasn't all that bad having to work on your birthday then.
40 <SEP> i would feel so loved if someone did that for me, i never get attention like that.
40 <SEP> but it is you who choose which girl to marry and which one not.
40 <SEP> that was very thoughtful, you are very lucky!
40 <SEP> the game was full of intrigue.
40 <SEP> i've had shows that i've loved that have ended and it's like losing a best friend.
40 <SEP> you must be pretty smart to get a b thinking you did horrible.
40 <SEP> i did not expect that kind of reaction!
40 <SEP> but i guess i don't know enough about possums.
40 <SEP> that was crazy!
40 <SEP> i thought about majoring in english, too, but decided to go a different route.
40 <SEP> i still love the mcnuggets, but i never eat them since i went vegan.
40 <SEP> it's the best,  but it is hard to give up the delicious fried meats, though.
40 <SEP> i didn't see it lol
40 <SEP> but, it could be many other things instead.
40 <SEP> i could sleep if it wasn't closed all the way
40 <SEP> i used to but nowadays i don't what else
40 <SEP> i've read a decent amount of those, but i'm always looking for more.
40 <SEP> we have had a lot of rain here and when that happens large trees often come down.
40 <SEP> that is bad how did it happen
40 <SEP> i would of did the same.
40 <SEP> oh man how did you get it out
40 <SEP> i enjoy a little rain every once in a while, but i dont like thunderstorms either
40 <SEP> one year we had one hit a school in moore and a few children died.
40 <SEP> it was so devastating.
40 <SEP> thank goodness it wasn't something serious.
40 <SEP> i had the same problem.
40 <SEP> i am single too, but i did not lose my hope.
40 <SEP> that person needs to loose their license i believe - you are so blessed you were not hurt.
40 <SEP> i was induced when i had my daughter a year ago!
40 <SEP> lucky you didn't have to go to the hospital!
40 <SEP> but i would still be on the look out for next time...they are the relatives of godzilla after all.
40 <SEP> i had to get a few staples in my head but my car was totaled...
40 <SEP> as long as you did your best, i say have no regrets.
40 <SEP> i have had an experience like that.
40 <SEP> it was just a cat.
40 <SEP> well, i would probably feel the same way, but i'm sure you will be great.
40 <SEP> if they didn't have confidence in your abilities, they wouldn't have chosen you to do it!
40 <SEP> oh, thank god you were escape you have to thank god for doing great things
40 <SEP> he did not do anything bad to you.
40 <SEP> it's like that feeling when you hit a bump on the road but 100x worse!
40 <SEP> i once was bitten by a snake, luckily it had no venom.
40 <SEP> good have ended a lot worse if that gas station wasn't there.
40 <SEP> hope you had a good camping night!
40 <SEP> i had a similar problem where my car overheated in the middle of nowhere.. so you never know.. anything can happen
40 <SEP> i was 22.
40 <SEP> registering for college classes and i was freaking out so bad, they just told me to come back the next day.
40 <SEP> i didn't go back
40 <SEP> you never know, but leaving family is hard.
40 <SEP> i was looking it up the other day thinking about moving somewhere else and that state was even worse.
40 <SEP> i had that problem when i was kid.
40 <SEP> i had similar fears growing up.
40 <SEP> me also when i was young.
40 <SEP> i had no idea
40 <SEP> but my advice to you is do not count on them too much as they have astronomically low chances of winning even anything at all
40 <SEP> my dog did that the other day.
40 <SEP> who else was in the car
40 <SEP> oh no, i had a older cousin who did that to me as well.
40 <SEP> i would always sit down where i was and start crying.
40 <SEP> i can imagine, it happend to me before and it was actually someone trying to break in, i called hte police and they ran off
40 <SEP> well that was observant of her.. sometimes people dont even notice
40 <SEP> everything was in the end, but at first not so much.
40 <SEP> that's a very stressful time in a person's life, but i'm sure she'll adapt!
40 <SEP> my heart was racing and then boom out pops my cat.
40 <SEP> the rat snakes are great though...i would never hurt them..but i don't want them near me or in eye vision!
40 <SEP> omg..i use that word, i didn't think anyone else did!
40 <SEP> i've heard of it, but i can't even imagine going through it.
40 <SEP> you did the right thing.
40 <SEP> oh, my dad use to play with those all the time when we were young and he'd let us touch them!
40 <SEP> i never did want to hold it, but i was curious enough to touch it!
40 <SEP> it's a good thing that he was there to take care of it.
40 <SEP> they are important to the ecosystem but i wish they would stay away from me
40 <SEP> was it big
40 <SEP> oh yea that was creepy
40 <SEP> oh thank goodness it was nothing serious.
40 <SEP> almost three years ago, i was actually struck by lightning while in my home.
40 <SEP> wish she didn't get hurt though.
40 <SEP> at least it wasn't a stranger trying to break in!
40 <SEP> thank goodness the outcome was good.
40 <SEP> i didn't stick around to ask, i ran.
40 <SEP> but afterwards i was thinking it was a ghost.
40 <SEP> well at least it was nothing serious.
40 <SEP> i can't watch those anymore like i used to when i was a teenager.
40 <SEP> once, i was watching a horror movie a loooong time ago and the phone was ringing in the movie and then didn't work all of a sudden and then it happened to me and my friend in real life right at the same time!
40 <SEP> it was crazy but it was just a storm outside.
40 <SEP> i felt like that when my kids were younger.
40 <SEP> i used to watch some of them when i was in my 20's.
40 <SEP> but try not to let it bite your conscience.
40 <SEP> neat, did you like it/
40 <SEP> i'm sure you did good on the application.
40 <SEP> at least they didnt get you then!
40 <SEP> well, at the time i was holding out for a similar paying job like i had before but i could not find one and i ended up working fast food.
40 <SEP> i had to downsize my place as well.
40 <SEP> never know if the thing is going to bite off your bellybutton or not.
40 <SEP> it was awful.
40 <SEP> hope it wasn't a mean dog.
40 <SEP> i can imagine it was!
40 <SEP> i was in a accident years ago and found glass coming out of my scalp for weeks.
40 <SEP> they were setting of fireworks here since june and have been driving me nuts.
40 <SEP> you were lucky!
40 <SEP> well, at least you were able to conquer your fear!
40 <SEP> but you'll make it up as soon as you can, i'm sure!
40 <SEP> i think it was much creepier than average horror movies.
40 <SEP> i'm not sure what that means, but you should talk to him about it!
40 <SEP> well he was the one that caused it, so that's what he gets.
40 <SEP> the car started swaying side to side from the rear tires but i just took my foot off the gas and let the car do what it wanted until i was able to stop.
40 <SEP> goodness, it was a good thing you were right there and able to usher them inside so quickly.
40 <SEP> i can't imagine the results had you not been able to get to them quick enough!
40 <SEP> i was under a lot of stress.
40 <SEP> if i did it would not have been too severe.
40 <SEP> if i was you, i would get my own gun!
40 <SEP> it's disappointing to deal with your uncle's negativity, but you can't let it distract you from moving in a positive direction.
40 <SEP> my dad wasn't the best either at understanding how fragile kids can be.
40 <SEP> but he was still a good da
40 <SEP> should have taken pictures of it and used the internet to help you figure out what it was!
40 <SEP> thankfully he walked on past you but what a horrible experience all round.
40 <SEP> well, actually, i think that makes sense considering you were a kid and you were use to them being with you upstairs.
40 <SEP> the only time i've seen one up close is when a professional was handling one.
40 <SEP> but, the good news is, if you aren't typically late for your bills, the utilities companies will often cut you a break.
40 <SEP> i had that happen near me before too.
40 <SEP> i had to use a hand towel once!
40 <SEP> i wasn't thinking at the time.
40 <SEP> i had that experience
40 <SEP> probably did the wrong thing.. up to no good.
40 <SEP> i was the same way about dogs for a long time.
40 <SEP> peopel talk a lot about a trade war but, leave out the fact that places like the eu already tax our goods at much higher rates than we tax theirs.
40 <SEP> same..i was about 5 in the deep end by myself.
40 <SEP> once, but it burned the wall so my mom got rid of it
40 <SEP> i once saw my shadow on the blinds in my living room.
40 <SEP> i sat there frozen thinking someone was outside.
40 <SEP> then, i moved and the shadow did too!
40 <SEP> yea but i mean afterwards you dont know if you passed the interview
40 <SEP> but you just said you do like them.
40 <SEP> i was watching a house for a familty member and they're safe was stolen.
40 <SEP> but they can have their good moments.
40 <SEP> at least it wasn't a robber.
40 <SEP> i think i was one of the last one's not required to take foreign language.
40 <SEP> i did that myself, and i can tell you it was well worth it.
40 <SEP> i am much happier now than i ever was.
40 <SEP> she hadn't been around too many other people besides her dad, me, and a cousin or two.
40 <SEP> there was an open house at the school she was going to and all of us went to meet her teacher and get a feel for her classroom.
40 <SEP> oh no, how did you end up in that situation.
40 <SEP> at least it wasnt an intruder.
40 <SEP> last time my car had problems, i had to spend so much money.
40 <SEP> it was awful.
40 <SEP> that is usually pretty unlikely but i'm rooting for you.
40 <SEP> i am sure you did fine.
40 <SEP> that's a shame, but sometimes it is good to face our fears.
40 <SEP> we dealt with roaches before, but got rid of them.
40 <SEP> i'm sure it was.
40 <SEP> i had a lump on my back but got it removed.
40 <SEP> i think it was stress related.
40 <SEP> i saw it when i was much older but my parents didn't let me watch it when i was young.
40 <SEP> hope you didn't have too many nightmares over it.
40 <SEP> but i work too much to go
40 <SEP> i thought the voice was telling you to feed the pigs again.
40 <SEP> weren't we are like that...
40 <SEP> but she's just being playful.
40 <SEP> my boyfriend had issues with his foot, he's even had a few hospital stays for it.
40 <SEP> his was too.
40 <SEP> he had an ulcer that got very infected.
40 <SEP> luckily we don't have kids to complicate things, but her job wears her out and it doesn't seem like she can physically or mentally keep up with it.
40 <SEP> baby boomers didn't do that great either.
40 <SEP> well at least you were unharmed!
40 <SEP> but i would understand that you wouldn't want to have to deal with the after effects.
40 <SEP> i bet you didn't get much sleep.
40 <SEP> please becareful my friend had his phone stolen recently because of the same thing
40 <SEP> i like cats, but not those kind of cats
40 <SEP> i tried to use hulu once but it wasnt for me.
40 <SEP> i didn't even know that was a thing.
40 <SEP> i had an experience like that before - one that i never want to live again.
40 <SEP> my favorite was the shining
40 <SEP> i bet it did.
40 <SEP> i do actually hit blank walls a lot of times but i get by
40 <SEP> i wish i could relate, but i've never had to go to court.
40 <SEP> but this doesn't have to define you.
40 <SEP> i didn't even realize in mid michigan we did until i almost stepped on one..i had a panic attack too lol
40 <SEP> oh haha well that'll be interesting...at least the kids will feel good that they were braver than mommy hahaha
40 <SEP> thank god there was someone there to intervene.
40 <SEP> thats a lot of miles, but they make cars good these days.
40 <SEP> oh man, i bet you didn't sleep for weeks!
40 <SEP> no, it wasn't.
40 <SEP> luckily you weren't hurt though!
40 <SEP> i hear thats an amazing show but i've never seen it before
40 <SEP> but rain is lovely.
40 <SEP> i used to believe they were in my closet too
40 <SEP> you will likely never hear about any of this stuff in a doctors office, but it can heal almost anything!
40 <SEP> moving to a new place can make you uneasy, but once you make a couple of friends you'll get over it.
40 <SEP> i almost got nabbed by a ghost the last time i was alone.
40 <SEP> mine did that, too.
40 <SEP> we had to replace the motion sensor.
40 <SEP> my old ford focus had a similar issue.
40 <SEP> oh thank goodness it wasn't serious.
40 <SEP> that's very true, but i'm sure their both very smart and know how to avoid dangerous situations.
40 <SEP> i used to get chased by dogs too , back then when i was younger fences were not to common
40 <SEP> lucky you , i was bit a few times but it was my fault i provoked the dogs
40 <SEP> that happened once in a house i was renting.
40 <SEP> my current crew is about 35 people but i  need at least 5 more.
40 <SEP> surely, it was just your imagination.
40 <SEP> oh no, did you end up lading safley.
40 <SEP> heh .. it was ok but kinda boring in a theater
40 <SEP> but at least you can still keep in touch nowadays.
40 <SEP> i was just looking at getting an emulator so i could play it again on my computer.
40 <SEP> please tell me that he was friendly and nothing creepy!
40 <SEP> lol i was like please tell me this was a positive experience...
40 <SEP> my house was swept up by one when i was a little kid.
40 <SEP> it was all swell and dandy until the darn flying monkeys swooped in.
40 <SEP> it's good that they were unsuccessful at least.
40 <SEP> good thing you didn't get lost!
40 <SEP> were you able to get her help in time!
40 <SEP> my dog would of looked around like, wasn't me daddy, i cross my paws.
40 <SEP> and hauled butt
40 <SEP> a lot of times i wake up and am relieved it was only a dream.
40 <SEP> we've had some pretty bad storms here too this year.
40 <SEP> ya it feels so weak to be in that place , but you should only give the strength required for your friend to overcome this situation
40 <SEP> there's no reason to waste that person's time.
40 <SEP> you want to please him but you have to take care of yourself, too.
40 <SEP> but yea, throwing yourself into a group of new people can be rough.
40 <SEP> well that's your choice, but i say new adventures in life are profitable!
40 <SEP> i can imagine but it is good to get out
40 <SEP> i have century link and it was up slightly today.
40 <SEP> well at least it wasn't as bad as the crash of 2008.
40 <SEP> less pay but more peace, health and time is always worth it :)
40 <SEP> i tried it when i was a student.
40 <SEP> it wasn't my cup of tea.
40 <SEP> i remember seeing very high americans wandering around as if tehy had over indulged.
40 <SEP> i am bad with anxiety too but if you haven't done anything wrong then all you can do is try to have some self confidence and prepare for the worst and hope for the best.
40 <SEP> sometimes we don't connect with someone good..but will regret it later.
40 <SEP> they've should have had similar feelings, so they should have been more understanding.
40 <SEP> i went to school for many years through a master's degree, and although it was hard, it was worth it.
40 <SEP> i didn't go to the gym forever!
40 <SEP> i had an anxiety when i first started coming to the gym.
40 <SEP> i didn't know how to use a couple of machines so i stayed on tradmill the whole time
40 <SEP> but you also don't want to be tied down to a bad place.
40 <SEP> i'm a cautious person.. if i felt like there was even a 50% chance of being able to find something close to decent, i'd turn them down.
40 <SEP> but if you think it's a desert out there and you can't find something to come close, it may be worth gritting your teeth and being there for a few years before you try to move on.
40 <SEP> i've seen it before but not with me personally
40 <SEP> i wouldn't stress so much if i were you.
40 <SEP> im sure once it was over you realized that you would be okay with that.
40 <SEP> good thing you were close to home.
40 <SEP> having anxiety about something can be hard to overcome but you can do it :)
40 <SEP> college was an odd time, people the same age you didn't know that well.
40 <SEP> but if you don't buy now, as the prices go higher, you will regret it
40 <SEP> your are torn between him being a man but you still think of him being your little boy
40 <SEP> you will enjoy it as he grows older because you had a hand in it and know that he will be prepared for it
40 <SEP> i went when i was a child.
40 <SEP> aw what was your favorite things to do while there
40 <SEP> of course it was, but next time you'll handle it better.
40 <SEP> but, sometimes an argument can get very interesting to watch!
40 <SEP> i suppose, but research and concrete knowledge is more beneficial as it is a very hands on and physical occupation, especially when the health of others are in their hands.
40 <SEP> she had better watch it.
40 <SEP> i had couple of interviews couple of years ago.
40 <SEP> was very nervous, but thankfully they all went well.
40 <SEP> she said it wasn't as bad as she expected.
40 <SEP> but i think if you just go for it, breathe deeply a bunch, and pretend it's just you in that room, i think you'll do great!
40 <SEP> dad was in the army.
40 <SEP> it's kind of annoying to deal with, especially because it's being motivated by your company possibly disappearing.. but it won't take long at all to craft a good one, especially because oftentimes the shorter they are, the better
40 <SEP> if i were you i would accept it because no amount of stress could stop me from making more money.
40 <SEP> yea it reminds me of a time i took a risk on an investment.
40 <SEP> i took a trip to europe once.
40 <SEP> even if you were a little anxious.
40 <SEP> i'm sure that was a wise thing to do.
40 <SEP> i've actually heard a little bit about cbd oil from my sister, but i never did any research myself or try it out.
40 <SEP> who did , tell me more
40 <SEP> i am sure you were.
40 <SEP> but think there will be many new people, so you will not be the only one in the same situation
40 <SEP> if people knew it was because of spiders they'd totally understand.
40 <SEP> but it's a fresh start.
40 <SEP> right, but deep down i'm sure you know that you don't need a relationship to feel content!
40 <SEP> those systems are abuse prone but, some people need them.
40 <SEP> for example, over a 3 year period in my own state, there was about ~20 million dollars worth of food stamps spent in major vacation hot spots (florida, hawaii, california, virgin islands)
40 <SEP> that can be tough to do, but will pay off in the long run!
40 <SEP> it is always good to work out but start slowly since it has been a long time since your last work out.
40 <SEP> i do like being alone sometimes but if not then i just want to be with someone i trust- they are not always available.
40 <SEP> i'm sure it was, but it always a great idea to be looking to improve yourself or your position.
40 <SEP> but it all depends on what kind of animal you get
40 <SEP> i did that with my new cat and it ended up working out ok.
40 <SEP> i had a similar experience playiing little league baseball.
40 <SEP> since you were not at fault.
40 <SEP> but who knows how the whole thing will turn out.
40 <SEP> but soon the routine will set in again and all will be good.
40 <SEP> i've only heard a little about them but they're a good brand!
40 <SEP> i can see that, i had my first beer at 13 due to my brother but knew it was wrong at my age.
40 <SEP> so close, but so far.
40 <SEP> i'm sure you did great!
40 <SEP> haha but you survied, go you!
40 <SEP> it was hilarious, but i sympathise with her and you.
40 <SEP> i bet you didn't sleep that night!
40 <SEP> well take it from me, i have one and twins on the way.... never wanted kids either but once theyre here it's an amazing feeling!
40 <SEP> you will never be ready but enjoy as  much as you can while you're young!
40 <SEP> i haven't, but i would love to get one.
40 <SEP> he lowered taxes.
40 <SEP> i guess you were hungru
40 <SEP> the same habit that i took up
40 <SEP> i can't remember a time in school that i didn't have a backpack on me.
40 <SEP> it was difficult for you
40 <SEP> i have never been before since i was either very ill or had babies/kids.
40 <SEP> my husband and i tried to adopt from japan but our paperwork expired before we could and then i got pregnant.
40 <SEP> i was just about to mention that you should be careful that its not a scam of some sort.
40 <SEP> you must be nervous, but im sure you will be fine
40 <SEP> but, i take the4 view that things like that happen for a good reason and you'll end up in a better position down the line.
40 <SEP> but stay positive - it might not happen!
40 <SEP> my dog never used to do that, it was only just recently that he started doing that.
40 <SEP> i didnt even know you had internet in prison!
40 <SEP> honestly, if you had a crappy obamacare bronze plan its unlikely they'd pay for anything anyways.
40 <SEP> you've got to spend a fair amont of cash before they cover anything but a checkup.
40 <SEP> but i'm sure you'll do great!
40 <SEP> at least the experience was worthwhile.
40 <SEP> oh well it wasnt on purpose.
40 <SEP> i was too, but then i realized everyone was too and i made a lot of friends!
40 <SEP> i have had one too, its not a good thing
40 <SEP> but falling there doesn't accomplish a thing.
40 <SEP> i've had that done before.
40 <SEP> i remember my wife saying that when she was pregnant with both of ours.
40 <SEP> that was brave of you to talk to her.
40 <SEP> ah man, i built my own computer about a year ago...it had like 10 important, expensive parts, and i had to wait for them all!
40 <SEP> school concerns as it appears now after realizing, were much more hassle free
40 <SEP> it was a wonderful job.
40 <SEP> well then i guess you should have went and checked to see if anyone was hurt.
40 <SEP> but at least christmas is around the corner.
40 <SEP> i wonder what drugs they were on.
40 <SEP> good thing he wasn't drunk or he very well could have gotten in an accident.
40 <SEP> expensive ingredients but some are the some from people and dog meds for cataracts/dry eye etc.
40 <SEP> i'm 50 and haven't rode one since i was 2.
40 <SEP> but i'm on a budget and it's where i have to go.
40 <SEP> i would tell you to think of everyone in their underwear, but i am pretty sure that advice never works!
40 <SEP> i've been regular rod and reel fishing and love it, but i've never been fly fishing.
40 <SEP> once people get to know me its fine but usually people dont like me when they first meet me.
40 <SEP> it makes sure that you don't say anything inappropriate but you still feel semi comfortable!
40 <SEP> i've never flown before, the only time i have ever been on a plane was when i went skydiving.
40 <SEP> well, this is how you get some, but having to deal with situations where your only choice is to wait patiently!
40 <SEP> but people don't honk or yell, that's just being hostile!
40 <SEP> it took me forever to sign up for my speech communications class because of speaking in public.
40 <SEP> but i'm sure being apart will be difficult for both of you.
40 <SEP> i am sure you did fine on it.
40 <SEP> and besides, if you did poorly, there is always the good ole local mcdonalds.
40 <SEP> the closest thing that i have experienced was serving as a guard during a military court martial.
40 <SEP> my younger brother had the same problem early on, but he turned out to just be a slow developer.
40 <SEP> hope something horrible didn't happen to you just to get it.
40 <SEP> wish it had happened to me!
40 <SEP> true but the odd's are slim.
40 <SEP> you know there are websites were you can answer a few questions about the person you are buy a gift for and then it makes gift recommendations for that person.
40 <SEP> they are very busy but if she made an appointment with you then she should be there on monday.
40 <SEP> chemicals mean serious business, but you landed the job.
40 <SEP> as it should, but a bad grade is not the end of the world.
40 <SEP> i feel that way sometimes but it's the best way to learn, and it only gets easier!
40 <SEP> but she needs you.
40 <SEP> but they usually end up being better than you expect.
40 <SEP> but at least you took the time to prepare!
40 <SEP> i'm not sure what you might be going through but do consider making sure youre eating a good amount of fruits and veggies.
40 <SEP> i've had that feeling as well, especially if it is with someone that is close to me.
40 <SEP> i dont recall the names off the top of my head but some self help books with the topic have helped me in the past!
40 <SEP> another thing that helped me was thinking about how good it felt if a stranger started talking with me in public for a 2-5 minute conversation and how it didnt upset me or make them look stupid so i shouldnt look stupid if i did the same thing.
40 <SEP> i think butterflies are good to have to make us do our best and it shows your job is important to you and you want to do a good job.
40 <SEP> work is important but your health is way more important!
40 <SEP> i do..but i don't like it
40 <SEP> some people like to blame everything else but themself!
40 <SEP> i was going through with an adoption, but same amount of responsibilities nonetheless.
40 <SEP> there's ups and downs, but you get used to the responsibilities.
40 <SEP> there are other options in life but you must always follow your heart when making such important decisions.
40 <SEP> i bet you've had to do a lot of prep work.
40 <SEP> mine was from being in one and just being nervous about having to be in charge of things.
40 <SEP> if it's like mine-you had to wait forever!
40 <SEP> i lived thru hurricane andrew and it was traumatizing
40 <SEP> there's nothing you can do but you need to do something!
40 <SEP> i had to do a long drive from nebraska to colorado this summer.
40 <SEP> it was about a 7-hour drive.
40 <SEP> that was starting to push it.
40 <SEP> he was so upset and wouldnt stop crying.
40 <SEP> i got lucky there he was fine after we got him away from the doctors office and got him his very treat.
40 <SEP> i lived there for a few months, but there was too much traffic and noises that kept me up.
40 <SEP> on the other, the best day of my life so far was when my youngest was potty-trained!
40 <SEP> but you need to rehearse in front of a mirror,  that will help
40 <SEP> i was a little too young to be playing that game when it came out.
40 <SEP> my stepdad had the first one though.
40 <SEP> all i remember was "leon!!!"
40 <SEP> friends in florida had to evacuate.
40 <SEP> just wear cologne, dress sharp, use mouthwash, and let her do all the talking.
40 <SEP> well at least it wasnt all for nothing
40 <SEP> i've had that before.
40 <SEP> my husband likes the los angles chargers but they arent very good!
40 <SEP> i didn't know film existed anymore lol
40 <SEP> i almost passed out when they were doing the epidural!
40 <SEP> well, it's been a lot longer since i did calculus.
40 <SEP> it was not your fault.
40 <SEP> well at least it wasn't too bad...even if it was a little embarrassing.
40 <SEP> well did people  help you get cleaned off.
40 <SEP> well at least you didn't run off after it happened like some would have done.
40 <SEP> someone was probably laughing at you.
40 <SEP> that had to be painful
40 <SEP> i did that after swimming one day.
40 <SEP> i was so busy getting the kids dressed that i forgot to clean my face.
40 <SEP> it was so embarrassing.
40 <SEP> but i wouldn't sweat over it, it happens to the best of us and we learn fro our mistakes!
40 <SEP> that's so embarrassing, but hey everyone has those moments once in a while.
40 <SEP> i'm sure it wasn't so bad though in the end.
40 <SEP> well at least you wasn't the only one next time double check for everything before hitting the shower.
40 <SEP> i am sure she didn't like that.
40 <SEP> i've had so many embarrassing things happen.
40 <SEP> but why do you care if they're your cousin..
40 <SEP> i am sure that was embarrassing.
40 <SEP> i would hope that people had compassion for your situation and if they didn't, well shame on them.
40 <SEP> i once peed my pants at a wedding i was laughing so hard.
40 <SEP> aw, i love that he had you there with him when it happened.
40 <SEP> that was rude.
40 <SEP> i have had that happen too!
40 <SEP> it was very embarrassing!
40 <SEP> oh no, did anyone see
40 <SEP> oh lol, i'm sure it was embarrassing but it's happened to most, so understandable.
40 <SEP> i would've been so embarrassed if that was me.
40 <SEP> i would imagine they were quite delighted.
40 <SEP> at least he didn't take your driver's license and tow your car
40 <SEP> i've had that happen, too.
40 <SEP> i used to think that was my worst nightmare, but in the moment i just did my best to laugh it off so we could move forward faster
40 <SEP> you had that instinct.
40 <SEP> uh oh, how did they react to that
40 <SEP> probably they just fell bad for you, thank god it was not worse.
40 <SEP> it is embarrassing but you will get over it.
40 <SEP> if it took you that long to notice, i bet no one else noticed.
40 <SEP> she was probably holding in a fart, too.
40 <SEP> oh well i'm sure they didn't judge you, it could happen to anyone
40 <SEP> it's embarrassing in the moment, but i think there are more clumsy people all around us.
40 <SEP> haha oh man did the owner get mad...or did he just laugh it off
40 <SEP> at least you were able to get more since it was a buffet.
40 <SEP> well, it was fortunate that you got it back ok.
40 <SEP> it was a good learning lesson.
40 <SEP> that was a very bold move on your part.
40 <SEP> but sometimes fortune favors the bold, as they say.
40 <SEP> but i'm sure it will fade from memory eventually.
40 <SEP> i remember doing something similar when i was younger.
40 <SEP> there was a pool outside of our screen door.
40 <SEP> that had to feel embarrassing!
40 <SEP> but just imagine if you watched that happen to someone else.
40 <SEP> it is kind of odd to look at ourselves from that long ago, and we didn't even realize what we looked like usually at that time.
40 <SEP> oh, i thought you stole them, but i've done that before too.
40 <SEP> nah, if they were understanding it's all good!
40 <SEP> probably but that is still the worst thing ever.
40 <SEP> suprised you didn't learn it earlier haha
40 <SEP> oh no :( it happens though, it wasn't your fault!
40 <SEP> my family was the same way growing up.
40 <SEP> at least you had something to cover yourself with!
40 <SEP> oh man that had to be embarrassing.
40 <SEP> i used to overspend when i was younger and have learned to get it under control lately.
40 <SEP> at least it didn't turn into one of those cheesy 80's movies
40 <SEP> i am sure she understands it was an accident.
40 <SEP> that didn't go well then.
40 <SEP> obviously you didn't come up with some dumb lie and make it seem like they made the mistake and not you.
40 <SEP> i am sure you did, but at least you don't look crazy every day like i do.
40 <SEP> thankfully you had a sweater, but geez how embarrassing.
40 <SEP> the were semi-finalists in 1998 and have had lots of good players over the years (prosinecki, suker, boksic, savicevic, boban)
40 <SEP> i always loved their strip when i was younger.
40 <SEP> it was the first time a team had played in checks.
40 <SEP> whoops, guess you were embarassed.
40 <SEP> i've done that before but at least you got back up!
40 <SEP> ugh, i'm sure that was hard.
40 <SEP> that must of hurt even if it didn't break.
40 <SEP> if they did, you could've reversed the situation and summoned everybody over to throw down and have a supremo wine fest.
40 <SEP> i am sure you did!
40 <SEP> well, i guess it didn't turn out too bad.
40 <SEP> oh my goodness, i can only imagine how horrible that was for you.
40 <SEP> i bet it didn't go as bad as you think!
40 <SEP> that was so rude of her to make that comment in front of everyone.
40 <SEP> well, at least you were honest about it.
40 <SEP> at least everyone was still at work and you werent left there alone!
40 <SEP> that had to be traumatic.
40 <SEP> you obviously weren't alone
40 <SEP> but it happens.
40 <SEP> hoping the beta was okay.
40 <SEP> im sure it wasnt as bad as you imagined it in your head unless other people watching the movie told you to hush
40 <SEP> i imagine you can just explain to her that the message was sent to her by mistake.
40 <SEP> i would be freaking out if i were you!
40 <SEP> that had to be so embarrassing!
40 <SEP> ahw that was good
40 <SEP> i am sure he/she understood you were just nervous.
40 <SEP> oh god, i've done many things but that is actually one i have not done.
40 <SEP> hey, the party was probably worth it.
40 <SEP> that could be some trauma there... but i am sure you will get back into the swing of things (no pun intended).
40 <SEP> but it's part of life, stuff happens.
40 <SEP> oh that was awkward
40 <SEP> ah i am an eagles fan, but we finally got you this year
40 <SEP> i am sure it was not that bad.
40 <SEP> omg, that had to be embarrassing and a mess to get up.
40 <SEP> i've had that happen a few times to me.
40 <SEP> i had a similar experience the other day at the gas station.
40 <SEP> kids like touching and looking at things, i'm sure no real harm was done.
40 <SEP> i would love to go on trips except that my boss wouldn't like it if i did!
40 <SEP> certainly must appreciate your co-workers candidness.
40 <SEP> well, it's time for a wash then.
40 <SEP> well on the bright side at least you had a suit.
40 <SEP> that's a good thing that it wasn't another type of drink!
40 <SEP> oh, it was an accident, and it's alright.
40 <SEP> you were either very imaginative or upset.
40 <SEP> thought that reminded me of death note, but i think l only focused on criminals.
40 <SEP> at least you didn't damage your bike
40 <SEP> it's okay, next just tell them that you didn't quiet understand what they meant and so they will explain it again
40 <SEP> oh no, did anyone notice
40 <SEP> i've had that happen before.
40 <SEP> not at walmart but at a dentist office.
40 <SEP> it was crazy awful!
40 <SEP> good that you finally took control of the situation
40 <SEP> at least it was water and not coffee or juice
40 <SEP> at least he didn't pick up!
40 <SEP> one thing i've learned is that it might be embarrassing for a couple minutes but most of the time, an hour later, nobody will remember what happened.
40 <SEP> i've done something similar, but could call my husband to sneak in some clean clothes - they are useful now and again!
40 <SEP> but if they don't have any proof then it's meaningless.
40 <SEP> it's hard to be accused of something you didn't do.
40 <SEP> sometimes that happens when you take a break from something for too long, but with some practice you might be able to pick it back up again
40 <SEP> i could have took the day off,but i went in anyway.
40 <SEP> omg, did you hurt yourself bad
40 <SEP> well at least you didn't have to walk out without paying.
40 <SEP> good thing your boss was available.
40 <SEP> it happens to all of us but its so painful and awkward.
40 <SEP> were you okay
40 <SEP> i am sure you were embarrassed.
40 <SEP> were you drunk!
40 <SEP> oh no :( it happens though, it wasn't your fault!
40 <SEP> my family was the same way growing up.
40 <SEP> i would be as well if i were you.
40 <SEP> in my personal experience, you can watch and advise all you like, but they often won't listen - my mom was like that.
40 <SEP> if they would have had you on camera, they would have already come after you for it.
40 <SEP> but going forward you can live in a way that minimizes regret.
40 <SEP> then i just realized how much they had no right to judge me.
40 <SEP> i'm eating low-carb right now but i'm a pushover for good mashed potatoes!
40 <SEP> oh no, was the cop understanding
40 <SEP> hmm, how did that make you feel
40 <SEP> i was an accident and we all have accidents sometimes.
40 <SEP> you probably shoulf have told them that wasnt a decent thing to do.
40 <SEP> i did the same with my mother all the time when i was in my early teens.
40 <SEP> but i think our parents understand and don't take it to heart, because they usually did the same thing too :)
40 <SEP> well you did what you were supposed to do.
40 <SEP> well if the cat didn't tell the truth he didn't mind atking the fall.
40 <SEP> you probably did it for good reason.
40 <SEP> uhnnn,most of us did!
40 <SEP> i wish i had a slow cooker.
40 <SEP> was she upset!
40 <SEP> i had a technical difficulty.
40 <SEP> either way, i'm sure there were no hard feelings.
40 <SEP> true but chips taste sooo much better
40 <SEP> i have had that happen too.
40 <SEP> i used to be a food addict as well when i was younger.
40 <SEP> so you said you were going out of town.
40 <SEP> but however she will understand
40 <SEP> that helped me the one time i was able to quit.
40 <SEP> but its okay to cheat a little every now and then!
40 <SEP> oh, i could do that if i didn't have bad teeth and can't handle the cold.
40 <SEP> haha we all did crazy things when we were young!
40 <SEP> wait until the shopkeeper was busy with someone else.
40 <SEP> you must be feel a bit guilty, but thats okay
40 <SEP> i used to do that but with coins and stuff.
40 <SEP> thats fair enough, took many biscuits bad for the health
40 <SEP> i've never cried at work, but i've wanted to lol.
40 <SEP> but, sometimes you just got to tough it out.
40 <SEP> i think if you're respectful and state what you did wrong and how you'll fix it, she will forgive you.
40 <SEP> i am not a big drinker myself, but i wouldn't feel guilty about it.
40 <SEP> they probably didn't think twice or care as long as you weren't a jerk.
40 <SEP> i didn't know it could spread like that.
40 <SEP> i didn't understand you.
40 <SEP> it might have upset him but i'm sure he'll understand!
40 <SEP> everyone loses their temper sometimes and it's not like you didn't have a legit reason
40 <SEP> that was uncalled for.
40 <SEP> it can be a hard lesson to learn but will make you a better student.
40 <SEP> if you regret what you did you should go apologise for you said to him!
40 <SEP> i heard that was going around.
40 <SEP> as long as she knows where your intentions are the amount doesn't matter we all wish we can do more but we do what we can don't be down.
40 <SEP> but its okay, we are all human and make human mistakes some times.
40 <SEP> i was allowed to kind of run wild, so never had any issues with staying out till sunrise.
40 <SEP> it's sweet that she was waiting up for you.
40 <SEP> at least it wasn't something you did on purpose.
40 <SEP> i can't even imagine how embarrassing that was.
40 <SEP> you had too many bills to pay.
40 <SEP> well, all you could do was apologize and offer to buy another one.
40 <SEP> hope it wasn't too embarassing!
40 <SEP> i have never been there but i have heard that before too.
40 <SEP> i was caught stealing once when i was younger.
40 <SEP> it was so embarassing, never did it again.
40 <SEP> i believe i was fifteen.
40 <SEP> were they pokay
40 <SEP> woah how did you manage to eat 12 pizzas
40 <SEP> i have had that happen to me before, too.
40 <SEP> oh that was good of you.
40 <SEP> it was a tough transition but i never went back.
40 <SEP> i got some bad grades in college and told my parents i was doing better than i was.
40 <SEP> that was pretty risky.
40 <SEP> well i am sure you did the best you could with it.
40 <SEP> well, at least he knew what he was getting into right from the start lol.
40 <SEP> but, don't shoplift again, otherwise you will get into trouble
40 <SEP> as long as it takes you from a to b and safe to drive that's all that matters:) i used to have 1995 camry and it looked old and beat up but it was the best car i've had
40 <SEP> wasn't expecting that.
40 <SEP> but kissing your girlfriend is hardly something to be shamed of.
40 <SEP> a lot of people say they care about these issues but i'd like to see more people put their money where there mouth is.
40 <SEP> i'm not great at math either but i think you could find some online forums willing to help you.
40 <SEP> it's a waste of money if you don't finish it!
40 <SEP> but you are human!
40 <SEP> oh no, please tell me that did not happen to you today.
40 <SEP> i think it was with birthday cake.
40 <SEP> but hey, we all make mistakes and failing one class isn't the end of the world.
40 <SEP> but it gives you good closure!
40 <SEP> i was spanked as a child and know i deserved it.
40 <SEP> you know if it was necessary or not.
40 <SEP> he'll probably be upset, but i'm sure he'll come around.
40 <SEP> it was an accident.
40 <SEP> looks like it was just an accident.
40 <SEP> i have had to do that before.
40 <SEP> my family was very giving.
40 <SEP> i had to borrow money to get a second degree.
40 <SEP> hurt my pride, but it's okay.
40 <SEP> ok now i'm curious...what the hell did you do
40 <SEP> i think many children including myself stole things before they were taught it was wrong to steel.
40 <SEP> aww, i'm sure that's been nothing but positive for you.
40 <SEP> if it was a large, i am not sure how you didn't get sick.
40 <SEP> i'm sure she didn't mind it.
40 <SEP> aw, poor fellow, well i'm sure he was close to his home.
40 <SEP> it's one thing to relax, but that's different.
40 <SEP> you guys were together for so long.
40 <SEP> surely you were able to explain that this was out of your control.
40 <SEP> she lived a long life for a cat but its never long enough for us who they leave behind.
40 <SEP> it was a very devastating storm.
40 <SEP> he was only 35.
40 <SEP> it is a very long process, but it is true that time does help a tiny bit.
40 <SEP> it happens, you can't beat yourself up about it, it was an accident!
40 <SEP> but you must stay strong.
40 <SEP> there's got to be something that can be done but being international i'm not sure what.
40 <SEP> i've had that happen once.
40 <SEP> i had no idea snakes even lived that long.
40 <SEP> i am sure he was a faithful buddy to you.
40 <SEP> mistakes happen but it's good you are learning from it.
40 <SEP> take you were very close.
40 <SEP> but i'm not always looking at my phone.
40 <SEP> was it something that was in the family or was it something that you purchased.
40 <SEP> oh well that is convenient, good thing that they didn't remember that it was the day that you had requested off.
40 <SEP> my uncle, who was basically my father, died in april.
40 <SEP> you never get over it, but you do learn to live with it.
40 <SEP> i had never heard of that before.
40 <SEP> my dad has diabetes too but he was born with it.
40 <SEP> man i was hoping they would be able to help in some way!
40 <SEP> i was sure to check my statement and make sure there were no suspicious transactions.
40 <SEP> my son didn't experience until age 10.
40 <SEP> oh no, did you get it back
40 <SEP> i wish my dad were still around.
40 <SEP> were you able to do anything about it.
40 <SEP> i wish there was something more you could do.
40 <SEP> i have not, i did hear that england lost recently though.
40 <SEP> i heard they were doing great before the loss though, hope you at least got to see them in some good matches.
40 <SEP> just from those few sentences alone, i can tell you were very passionate about them.
40 <SEP> i would be to if i were in your shoes.
40 <SEP> i mean they were all crazy but i can't imagine a regime under clinton.
40 <SEP> he was so good in it.
40 <SEP> last week, my wife told me that she had a lover.
40 <SEP> i was feeling very hopeful that day.
40 <SEP> i am sure that was difficult.
40 <SEP> she was like a mom to me.
40 <SEP> our dog was 8 years old.
40 <SEP> it can be a very emotional time but it gets better over time.
40 <SEP> just know that it gets better and try to think about the great life he had because of you and your love!
40 <SEP> it sometimes helps to remember the good times you had together.
40 <SEP> we were able to work out a plan, but she had to get a loan temporarily.
40 <SEP> thats terrible, at least he wasnt a puppy i guess.
40 <SEP> crazy they wont even eat vegetables but they will eat rat poison.
40 <SEP> my dad had that happen to him and his dog when he was young, and he's told me about it as a warning to make sure i'm safe with ours.
40 <SEP> but if you feel comfortable with the idea, then i would consider it when the time is right.
40 <SEP> at least you weren't hurt.
40 <SEP> we've never facetimed, but that's such a good idea.
40 <SEP> but remember him for all the good times.
40 <SEP> it is, but you have got to keep grinding.
40 <SEP> yea he did some foul things to those people.
40 <SEP> i didn't try to give him too much specific advice, because most of it is just useless.
40 <SEP> it was not even your brother's fault.
40 <SEP> it's ok, it probably wasn't the cheetos that got him - rodents just don't have a long lifespan.
40 <SEP> you were, i'm sure, a hamster among hamsters.
40 <SEP> kids need a lot of unconditional love..but parents aren't always perfect and sometimes don't know how to love their kids like they should !
40 <SEP> it isn't right to tell his girlfriend in my opinion, but it is good if you speak to him about the situation.
40 <SEP> but, it's awful that anyone was.
40 <SEP> it doesn't make it easier that it was a person you knew, i'm sure.
40 <SEP> but that life and every single person on this planet will have to deal with that at some point in life.
40 <SEP> silver lining: she said she didn't want to fail you, so at least you passed your project.
40 <SEP> i was a kid then, but i remember my teachers reaction
40 <SEP> i can imagine, that was a pretty big deal!
40 <SEP> not much wasted then.
40 <SEP> pets are great but they sure are tragic.
40 <SEP> i had a friend with an aneurysm pass suddenly about 2 years ago.
40 <SEP> it was hard and i can't imagine how you feel with it being your father.
40 <SEP> but even more unfortunate
40 <SEP> i guess a lot of people say 3 strikes and your out, i'm done, but for me, i dont care who you are, i just dont give even second chances to most people!
40 <SEP> that is normal when you lose someone, but time heals everything
40 <SEP> i was very close to mine.
40 <SEP> was just talking to someone about that type of thing.
40 <SEP> i had a pet dog who was hit by a car back when i was in jr high.
40 <SEP> poor thing had no clue why you were mad
40 <SEP> i thought fidh were easy
40 <SEP> they probably already filled the position and it didnt have to do with you personally!
40 <SEP> she didnt deserve such an amazing person like you.
40 <SEP> you can always adopt, thats what we did!
40 <SEP> ive had one dogg that i love, but since she did its been hard to love again.
40 <SEP> i have had family members pass as well and it is never easy.
40 <SEP> my family gets into politics a lot, but fortunately it rarely turns hostile.
40 <SEP> i do hope nothing of value was stolen.
40 <SEP> if they were just vandals they probably did it to someone else to.
40 <SEP> they will find who did it.
40 <SEP> oh, i can see why now youve had a change of heart about the car.
40 <SEP> the arcades were always kind of noisy for me though.
40 <SEP> time can help, but it can't get you over the loss of a loved one.
40 <SEP> my parents had difficulties conceiving as well.
40 <SEP> that is crazy, i wonder what was wrong with it
40 <SEP> i have had to do this too with my best friends (my beloved dogs).
40 <SEP> i had the same feeling.
40 <SEP> we had a foster dog do it.
40 <SEP> i let my cats outside but supervised.
40 <SEP> she came back hungry, but she was fine.
40 <SEP> if you had waited, you wouldn't have been approved for the mortgage.
40 <SEP> if you had waited, you wouldn't have been able to get the house.
40 <SEP> money can always come back but your health is the most important thing.
40 <SEP> i am sure he did
40 <SEP> i had a friend who went through the same thing.
40 <SEP> but at least you can skip the commercials.
40 <SEP> my girlfriend and i were just talking about how horrible she's going to feel when she loses her havanese pup at some point in the distant future, since she's so close to her.
40 <SEP> but it's all about to how you're feeling.
40 <SEP> aww shoot, i lost a dog when i was little in a very tragic way as well.
40 <SEP> i miss that big guy, he was like a brother to me.
40 <SEP> i did the same with mine.
40 <SEP> i remember struggling with that too when i did my test.
40 <SEP> i was so nervous.
40 <SEP> i wish i didn't have to work so much so i could have spent more time with him when he wanted to
40 <SEP> you were too good for them anyway!
40 <SEP> but get out there and meet some new people.
40 <SEP> i am 42, 40 didn't bother me.....there is nothing you can do about the aging process.
40 <SEP> i wish i had watched it so you could talk more about it.
40 <SEP> i had a dog die a few years ago and it was traumatic.
40 <SEP> that happens sometimes but i'm sure you will make a lot of new friends in your new job.
40 <SEP> i was just talking about this with my friend.
40 <SEP> i wish there was something i could do to help
40 <SEP> people don't realize that can happen but it happened to my friend when we were little.
40 <SEP> i have kids, but they are toddlers.
40 <SEP> i left my parents and my country when i was 25 years old.
40 <SEP> probably the driver did not see her
40 <SEP> my grandmother was like that too.
40 <SEP> lmao how the heck did that happen
40 <SEP> i have no doubt she understood why you didn't though.
40 <SEP> i am sure you had good times.
40 <SEP> one died before the other, and the other was so depressed, she quickly followed.
40 <SEP> oh, well that is a long time, but a stronger bond as well
40 <SEP> that's tragic, i haven't had to deal with anything like that yet.
40 <SEP> not to make this about me, but i've had a lot of issues in my life that simply got worse over time because i kept it to myself.
40 <SEP> most definetly she was my constant companion.
40 <SEP> :) my cat's name was midnight.
40 <SEP> i had him it seemed forever.
40 <SEP> but please don't think all women are like that; many are loving and loyal.
40 <SEP> but you'll make new connections there, i'm sure.
40 <SEP> i'm sure she had the bests life she could being part of your family.
40 <SEP> but just realize that you are not the one acting weird.
40 <SEP> that was probably devastating
40 <SEP> i had to try to make friends and see my parents when i could.
40 <SEP> many people did, he was a likeable fellow!
40 <SEP> i wish there was some way i could help you, it is such a tough road.
40 <SEP> be there with her, but you have to take time to recharge yourself.
40 <SEP> think about all the good times you had together.
40 <SEP> but don't feel dejected.
40 <SEP> i'm sure he was a good pet.
40 <SEP> it should be based off skill and if you had the skill you should have gotten it.
40 <SEP> were you able to find them somewhere else
40 <SEP> my sisters dog used to roam the neighborhood a lot and one day he didn't come back either.
40 <SEP> his name was oreo.
40 <SEP> its ok, you can always make new memories, it will not replace what you have lost, but it is a start
40 <SEP> it was a great show
40 <SEP> i've never seen that but i love a good tear jerker!
40 <SEP> but you will see him soon and nowadays tehre are lots of ways to communicate
40 <SEP> no but i've had my hours so reduced that it wasn't working going to work due to everything going to union dues and transportation.
40 <SEP> im sure she had a very positive opinion of you as well.
40 <SEP> i can relate however b/c my sweet riley(dog) just had to be put to sleep due to congestive heart failure
40 <SEP> i should do the same thing, but i still start my day with a big glass of iced coffee every day.
40 <SEP> i saw her in 2011. we skype but it's not the same
40 <SEP> oh man..i just had someone go through that.
40 <SEP> but the memories will always cheer with us.
40 <SEP> i've only had one job like that.
40 <SEP> well i had one that did that and he lived to 17 so there may still be hope
40 <SEP> that's unfortunate but, an emergency is an emergency.
40 <SEP> potentially, he seemed a bit deadset, but we do not know too much all in all
40 <SEP> i never got in any fights, but i never got pushed around either.
40 <SEP> i have never heard of it, i did watch the movie though.
40 <SEP> actually they are, that is why so many die in captivity..they need proper lights and diet etc..i guess if you know how to take care of animals then no- but so many just don't care when they have a pet who relies on them
40 <SEP> but it will happen.
40 <SEP> she was my best friend.
40 <SEP> mine had the same.
40 <SEP> i remember mine couldn't remember me me but i could still make her laugh,
40 <SEP> usually moving your body helps but it depends on her situation... i would get a 2nd opinion!
40 <SEP> just try to cherish the memories that you was left with, think about all the good times
40 <SEP> or they were just bad people.
40 <SEP> but it's good to know she will be remembered
40 <SEP> i don't have any kids, but i can only imagine.
40 <SEP> but, i feel bad for you.
40 <SEP> those cars were built to last.
40 <SEP> i had a similar thing with a childhood friend who moved for school.
40 <SEP> i'm sure you're dog had a great life with you if it's any consolation.
40 <SEP> i am sure you will find another job, but it doesn't make it any less painful.
40 <SEP> that is true,  but you will meet new people and learn a lot!
40 <SEP> so you all had relatively all his life.
40 <SEP> i lost all my friends and had to make new ones, which sucks.
40 <SEP> i was pretty distraught when i lost my granddad as well.
40 <SEP> you could say he was part of your family.
40 <SEP> at least the computer didn't break.
40 <SEP> if there is no hope of her taking you back, then you have to find a way to move forward, but take the time you need to grieve as it is a loss.
40 <SEP> she was a very good singer.
40 <SEP> it wasn't from cancer, and we actually never thought he was going to pass away that day when he went to the hospital.
40 <SEP> but, it's very hard to lose loved ones!
40 <SEP> my mom thinks that her grandma's spirit is in me, because she died right before i was born.
40 <SEP> i did that last month.
40 <SEP> but as long as you're alive, you've got a chance.
40 <SEP> mine did too - 5 minutes ago, actually.
40 <SEP> i thought you two were going well.
40 <SEP> i didn't know about it.
40 <SEP> i didn't know that.
40 <SEP> i was devastated as well, he brought joy to all
40 <SEP> i didn't mean to type 5 lol.
40 <SEP> my daughters cat got run over like a week after we had him.
40 <SEP> but just think of all the wonderful new things he'll learn and friends he'll make.
40 <SEP> i remember when my nephew was born.
40 <SEP> i try to keep it in moderation now but even that is hard.
40 <SEP> oh that's so aggravating, my dog still has accidents but not many
40 <SEP> that's terrible but the rug is replaceable.
40 <SEP> i never played any sports in high school, i always had to work.
40 <SEP> it was a different kind of superhero movie.
40 <SEP> well the odds are quite bad but that still sucks
40 <SEP> you were probably not the only one who felt that way about the jewelry
40 <SEP> its always disappointing to not achieve something you were hoping for but it could also mean that a better position is in store for you.
40 <SEP> its crazy how our tax money paid for them to improve that and they never did.
40 <SEP> but you can't help it.
40 <SEP> she was probably disappointed at you.
40 <SEP> but these things happen in life
40 <SEP> you shouldn't feel ashamed for the crummy thing he did - you did nothing wrong.
40 <SEP> mine was 210.
40 <SEP> yea after the finals, at least he didnt go to the gsw haha
40 <SEP> i used to be a deadbeat but now my life is dope.
40 <SEP> i once had to pay in about a $1000 so count yourself lucky!
40 <SEP> i haven't had pizza ht in forever.
40 <SEP> she didn't have to yell
40 <SEP> pretty sure most people have that fantasy, but only the people brave enough actually go on the path to do it, like you
40 <SEP> the most i ever won was like 20 bux lol
40 <SEP> i would be disappointed in him if i were you.
40 <SEP> i don't, if it were up to me we would all be artificially inseminated and men would be kept like livestock.
40 <SEP> that is too bad that you had to learn a lesson that way.
40 <SEP> that is very unfortunate that you put all that work in and were let down.
40 <SEP> you should tell them you were hurt.
40 <SEP> oh, well, i guess that was a bit disappointing huh.
40 <SEP> but its the thought that counts.
40 <SEP> the meg, my colleague from work was disapointed beyond repair, he was telling us all not to watch it, i guess in a sense i am lucky
40 <SEP> i guess she didn't get a cat then.
40 <SEP> i did actually.
40 <SEP> long distance can be hard but honestly absence makes you love them even more!
40 <SEP> i went to ireland in july but i bought the tickets in march so they were pretty cheap.
40 <SEP> was it a fitness test or what
40 <SEP> no i my boyfriend had on the dolphins.. blah lol
40 <SEP> you said they didn't have a direct in a while do you mean like a direct game come out im no game wiz for the new age lol.
40 <SEP> you said they didn't have a direct in a while do you mean like a direct game come out im no game wiz for the new age lol.
40 <SEP> mistakes are made, but still.
40 <SEP> work is good for bills but it interferes a lot with life
40 <SEP> tiny sub-compact, but goes a long time on a tank.
40 <SEP> i am sure you did your best.
40 <SEP> good thing pizza was available
40 <SEP> i can't imagine you were a beacon of honesty when you were a kid.
40 <SEP> i doubt it was personal.
40 <SEP> hope you had a great party afterwards!
40 <SEP> oh well, at least it was something
40 <SEP> they are having a good season, but have had many bad ones.
40 <SEP> your family was being polite.
40 <SEP> if i did that my family would order a pizza, hah.
40 <SEP> that was probably us when we were little lol , my little nieces are the same way and they are such bad actors too
40 <SEP> i'm not always broke but i feel like what helps is leaving my credit / debit card at home and just carry cash for what i need
40 <SEP> just remember that means it was most likely for the best that she did ghost you, you wouldn't want to be with someone like that anyways.
40 <SEP> it sure did.
40 <SEP> that is the worst, i feel like my time is being wasted.
40 <SEP> you could, but it's always a gamble!
40 <SEP> true.. but it is for their own good only, discipline would help them moving forward
40 <SEP> but still annoying but  at least you getting it for free now
40 <SEP> i'm sure it was accidental.
40 <SEP> that is horrible, but i've been there myself.
40 <SEP> one day i'm sure your children will recognize and appreciate you had to go through for them.
40 <SEP> it's always good to save money, but still, it stinks.
40 <SEP> but there will be plenty of other opportunities!
40 <SEP> math was always my least favorite.
40 <SEP> i've had that happen before.
40 <SEP> my kid told me flat out that her brother did something when it was impossible that he could've so i knew instantly.
40 <SEP> oh that was so close.
40 <SEP> i had two places call me back for three interviews and then no offer.
40 <SEP> well, then it wasn't too bad.
40 <SEP> that had to be frustrating.
40 <SEP> but, at least you have other options!
40 <SEP> that is okay, at least she was honest with you about her preferences.
40 <SEP> i didnt think it was that great either.
40 <SEP> i get that, but all seasons are good, you miss the ones that it is not
40 <SEP> but if it keeps you acting good at home, then so be it.
40 <SEP> it is not what you know but who you know.
40 <SEP> no need to kiss butt.
40 <SEP> it wouldn't be the same, but at least you could share food and have a laugh!
40 <SEP> just gotta keep kicking butt and taking names!
40 <SEP> i had to take college algebra 3 times before i finally passed with an a.
40 <SEP> being grown up has it's perks but it's not as great as we thought it would be with all the responsibilities.
40 <SEP> you have a certain taste in mind but it's not quite right
40 <SEP> i think over time, they will realize how wasteful and meaningless their behavior is and would start to change for better
40 <SEP> my friend and i were out at the bars one night, doing the usual young people thing.
40 <SEP> they had been acting off a little all night, and when i asked if they were okay, they told me everything was fine.
40 <SEP> i knew this wasn't true since i had known this person for years, but the night came to a close and we got a cab home.
40 <SEP> it's good to focus, but surely you can take a few hours to take in the culture.
40 <SEP> i was told that recently.
40 <SEP> i had no friends in college either.
40 <SEP> i'm not sure what you mean, but disntance does tend to make things more difficult
40 <SEP> that's hard, but he will be back!
40 <SEP> i've had a roommate the past few years since i'm in college.
40 <SEP> first one i had battle depression and mental illness, and even checked himself into a behavioral center because he was feeling suicidal.
40 <SEP> well, i suppose it's a good thing you didn't know him.
40 <SEP> i guess so but it should be able to alleviate a lot of that loneliness.
40 <SEP> another thing i did was find a trader joe's or some sort of store and stock up on decent food.
40 <SEP> ah well at least you didnt feel lonely
40 <SEP> i'm in college, and i've had three different roommates so far, having to move three different times.
40 <SEP> i feel for you,but dont take it the hard way,its well
40 <SEP> i wish we had children so my husband could do that.
40 <SEP> well, it's always so annoying in the beginning, when you know you have to change, but to see how much work there is to do in order to reach that change.
40 <SEP> you may have more than you know but sometimes meeting new people will give you the fresh start you need
40 <SEP> but he/she is out there, chin up :)
40 <SEP> at least you were productive!
40 <SEP> but you got to give it a try
40 <SEP> i'll bet it was!
40 <SEP> stay strong, you're going to find someone that completes you and you will see that it was for the better.
40 <SEP> i was like that too but i found friends in my second year.
40 <SEP> it is hard at first but then it gets better.
40 <SEP> that was so mean
40 <SEP> i moved to small town and didn't have many friends at first.
40 <SEP> once i had my son and made more friends it got way better lol!
40 <SEP> that's tough, but it helps you learn what you like to do on your own.
40 <SEP> i'm still pretty introverted but i enjoy meeting new people now and it helps with my emotional state a ton.
40 <SEP> oh no, what did you do
40 <SEP> dealing with the loss of a loved one is always difficult but feeling alone in the grief must be so much worse.
40 <SEP> i am sure that it did.
40 <SEP> at least you had the dog to cheer you up!
40 <SEP> i used to have a had time making friends when i was younger.
40 <SEP> (cause i didnt have many friends).
40 <SEP> i felt the same avout my moms dog when he passed.something was missing in the house.
40 <SEP> i was college roommates with my sister and now we live hours apart.
40 <SEP> try to enjoy the quiet but not get down.
40 <SEP> but, it gives it back and it makes up the loneliness part.
40 <SEP> i have a solution for that, but i wouldn't advocate you doing it.
40 <SEP> its always tough in relationships but when you can't go see her or make her talk to you afterwards, i'm sure its extra hard.
40 <SEP> i bet the constant construction didn't help at all
40 <SEP> but i'm sure she'll be back before you know it!
40 <SEP> sometimes things don't work out, but you might just need more time to meet people and might want to hang in there.
40 <SEP> hope you didn't eat the entire cake lol!
40 <SEP> she didn't deserve you.
40 <SEP> i can't believe your friend did that to you.
40 <SEP> i thought bobcats were mythical like unicorns.
40 <SEP> probably once or twice in my life, but i dont go anywhere alone so... :/
40 <SEP> but i ended up meeting my partner through friends.
40 <SEP> but as time passes you will find another and be cheerful as ever.
40 <SEP> that can be tough but it also can be great to have time for yourself
40 <SEP> that is true, but they are out there.
40 <SEP> but join some clubs or get to know some people in your dorm area.
40 <SEP> i was late to an appointment recently because i got stuck in a traffic jam.
40 <SEP> i was too, until i started getting out more.
40 <SEP> my husband used to travel all the time for work and it was so lonely.
40 <SEP> i often times wish i didn't have any family and friends, would make things easier.
40 <SEP> my sister was in the very same situation as you and i can tell you, she made it through and her daughter is 9 now.
40 <SEP> my girlfriend's 90-year-old grandfather was a full-of-life wwii vet who lit up the room when he came in.
40 <SEP> of course, you're not as physically active, but you have to learn to utilize your life in different ways.
40 <SEP> it's a slow process in the beginning, but it can be life-changing.
40 <SEP> i mean on one hand you have all that time to yourself but at the same time i'm sure you miss them.
40 <SEP> well i am sure it was a good experience
40 <SEP> i wish i could empathize with you, but i've been lucky to avoid that kind of thing recently.
40 <SEP> but i do hope things will turn out differently for you soon.
40 <SEP> i dont to be honest just try to get through the day but ive never been in a relationship so it gets bad
40 <SEP> but i wish someday after getting married i will have my own.
40 <SEP> that had to be disappointing.
40 <SEP> that's interesting that he took the dog with him on a business trip, but who am i to judge!
40 <SEP> but i don't know all of the situation so i guess i shouldn't say for sure!
40 <SEP> you shouldn't let a day go wasted just because you don't have anyone to hang with!
40 <SEP> my family moved around a lot until i was 13.
40 <SEP> it was the right thing to do.
40 <SEP> it will take time, but i'm sure you'll be okay.
40 <SEP> it was hard at first, but i got used to it after some time.
40 <SEP> alone time is important but you will go crazy if you are always alone.
40 <SEP> ok, if that's what you decide to do i believe you have had time to think it through
40 <SEP> you may have been all by yourself, but you were the only one getting to celebrate!
40 <SEP> i think dogs are much more friendly, but that's just me!
40 <SEP> but still -- it's difficult!
40 <SEP> it might take a while but you'll start making friends and setting up a community around you.
40 <SEP> i did that as well and found i had to consistently get out and try to meet people.
40 <SEP> it wasn't always a success but after about 2 months, i started to have things to do.
40 <SEP> no more clogged drains, dirty dishes or anything but my own!
40 <SEP> we're separated by four and eight years, respectively, so we weren't as close as you two seem to be, but i always liked having them around.
40 <SEP> but, on the positive side, at least you found out what a jerk he was before you became more committed.
40 <SEP> well, then it seems like it was a good choice.
40 <SEP> i wanted to be on my own but i just didn't realize how it would be by myself.
40 <SEP> i used to be the social butterfly but now after a lot of trauma i am very anxious as well and i don't care to have people i don't trust around me anyhow.
40 <SEP> that's a tough change, but i suppose you'll have to try to join clubs and make new ones!
40 <SEP> it's harder as an adult, but you can make some by joining some adult clubs that focus on sports or recreation.
40 <SEP> childhood was a lot easier
40 <SEP> i wish i still had mine.
40 <SEP> you must be having bitter ,sweet emotion.i remember my mom was also emotional when i left boarding school for the first time.
40 <SEP> but you can make arrangements such that you see him every weekend.
40 <SEP> but now i want to see.
40 <SEP> but you'll be grateful once you get your money right.
40 <SEP> those were much simpler times
40 <SEP> i could sure but i will be starting over on payments, i might look into it.
40 <SEP> at the time it was a change and i like the ride of it, but i did not realize i would miss the sedan as much as i did.
40 <SEP> i did also .
40 <SEP> i've never read it, but i might check it out!
40 <SEP> i remember when my little girl was taking tap dance classes.
40 <SEP> its tough, but hey at least it's something.
40 <SEP> it's a shame that they were not able to keep the place going in her memory.
40 <SEP> i do not have any children, but i can imagine how crazy that is to watch them grow up!
40 <SEP> it was pretty great but it was rough at times.
40 <SEP> same sometimes, but i enjoy the freedom and indepence of being an adult.
40 <SEP> aww, i just had to put my dog down last month.
40 <SEP> who did you show it to.
40 <SEP> it was a bit simpler than all this adulting we have to do.
40 <SEP> my kids are almost raised and i'll probably go back to work soon, but would actually love a different degree now.
40 <SEP> i can only imagine how precious those chess matches were to you.
40 <SEP> i imagine, but i am sure the family will be reunited soon.
40 <SEP> we have two dogs now, but used to have cats, too.
40 <SEP> its nothing like when i was growing up
40 <SEP> that had to be a weird feeling.
40 <SEP> ive never been back to mine, but i can still picture in my mind what it looks like
40 <SEP> i wish there was more i could do to help out.
40 <SEP> i would probably keep it if i were you, more sentimental value than cash value anyway.
40 <SEP> ive been there several times but its not my favorite place
40 <SEP> mine never did
40 <SEP> i was severely dehydrated and i fainted.
40 <SEP> that is ok sometimes but getting out is important for you too
40 <SEP> i wish mine were still little like her.
40 <SEP> i wish i was with my family.
40 <SEP> i had the same thing happening to me with my dog.
40 <SEP> it was like the decline of the nick lineup.
40 <SEP> the characters were annoying, and the color palate was horrible.
40 <SEP> things were much simpler when we were kids.
40 <SEP> i guess you did
40 <SEP> lol nevermind....but that's a bummer, hope you saved pictures at least
40 <SEP> main reason i started going to the gym was to get a break lol
40 <SEP> oh i enjoyed board games when i was little too
40 <SEP> i wish i had a girlfriend like that.
40 <SEP> i was never talented in drawing.
40 <SEP> it'll be well worth it when you can laugh with him over the things he did!
40 <SEP> your heart was in the right place.
40 <SEP> so what did you do then
40 <SEP> yea thats what i was thinking too.
40 <SEP> i've been to a lot of countries but would love to go to italy.
40 <SEP> it had a double meaning to him!
40 <SEP> i still have some toys my grandma gave me when i was a baby.
40 <SEP> i'm sure sure was.
40 <SEP> those were the good old days
40 <SEP> aw, well that's good that it did.
40 <SEP> i was yelling at my boyfriend..
40 <SEP> my mother lives far away, and i live with my father, but its not ideal
40 <SEP> that's too bad you couldn't go, but memories are great to have!
40 <SEP> oh and thank you for your apology but i am truly content and have accepted it.
40 <SEP> but you must cherish every moment because soon our babies grow up and become great adults.
40 <SEP> i used to collect too when i was a kid, i still have some but they are probably worth nothing other than nostalgia.
40 <SEP> i like to make certain recipes my mother made when i was a kid for the same reason.
40 <SEP> i guess we all were though
40 <SEP> i mean, how did you see yourself when you were small
40 <SEP> i had a cat named barney too!
40 <SEP> we was a one-eyed grey tabby.
40 <SEP> i used to enjoy doing that with my grandmother, she'd tell me all about when my dad was little.
40 <SEP> i guess he doesn't do that often if you were blown away.
40 <SEP> i did when i was a kid.
40 <SEP> her name was terror.
40 <SEP> we weren't, only 2 1/2 years.
40 <SEP> it was just the two of us and we were very close, she passed away several years ago.
40 <SEP> she was a great woman.
40 <SEP> i wish i had kids.
40 <SEP> i was actually looking for mine the other day.
40 <SEP> i remember the good old days with those games you didn't need a monthly subscription to
40 <SEP> i felt that way when i was waiting for school to end.
40 <SEP> it sure did, it was the best vacation i have ever been on
40 <SEP> the first one i ever played was pokemon blue.
40 <SEP> those were the good ol' days.
40 <SEP> but sometimes i think it's all relative.
40 <SEP> oh those were the good old days.
40 <SEP> i was also raised in the 90s.
40 <SEP> that's ok, i did not know much about it
40 <SEP> i wasn't my best self at that time.
40 <SEP> at least you had a good experience.
40 <SEP> those were the days!
40 <SEP> they did.
40 <SEP> that was a good time for me as well.
40 <SEP> that is how i find newer but similar music.
40 <SEP> i haven't picked one up yet, but i loved all the choices they made on it.
40 <SEP> i had only played the leaked beta from back in the day.
40 <SEP> i'd be so embarrassed if i was the losing family...but i'm sure they all got paid so it was worth
40 <SEP> oh, those were the days!
40 <SEP> i'm sure they will enjoy it like you did!
40 <SEP> i wish i had a group of friends like that.
40 <SEP> i always just knew people but never got close.
40 <SEP> that was the best show!
40 <SEP> i have the same feeling but for the last 90s and early 2000's.
40 <SEP> i think someone gave us ours but i can't remember.
40 <SEP> i bet you had a wonderful time together
40 <SEP> those were the days.
40 <SEP> probably so but they'll remember it in the future and have fond memories.
40 <SEP> i haven't, but i will check it out!
40 <SEP> those were good years for sure
40 <SEP> my message got cut short, but i love nintendo, the switch is amazing!
40 <SEP> those were the good old days.
40 <SEP> you are lucky to have had her
40 <SEP> those were our favorites  as kids
40 <SEP> i haven't had one in forever.
40 <SEP> mainly in the new mexico / colorado area -- but also to the alps.
40 <SEP> i used to love computer games too as a kid, but i always knew i had to disconnect with them.
40 <SEP> i haven't played much tennis but i miss having more free time to do similar hobbies.
40 <SEP> you had to stay still for 45 minutes for your picture to be taken.
40 <SEP> i bet it did.
40 <SEP> that is amazing that it was not torn down or remodeled.
40 <SEP> i tried to do the mobile game but i didn't get it lol
40 <SEP> possibly, but i doubt it could be worth anything.
40 <SEP> i think my earliest music media was cassettes.
40 <SEP> i wish it still was.
40 <SEP> it was hard.
40 <SEP> those were good years though.
40 <SEP> yea i hear that... it was much better back then
40 <SEP> there was an old game that i loved crash bandicoot.
40 <SEP> recently, they did a remaster of this game.
40 <SEP> i was playing this game several hours a day with friends.
40 <SEP> i remember people went nuts over the princess diana bear but she isn't worth anything at all after all.
40 <SEP> i was never truly explained the world of "bills"
40 <SEP> those were the days.
40 <SEP> i had a blast in high school.
40 <SEP> its great that you were able to go visit
40 <SEP> ugh i was hoping that is not the case, i would want my kid to be young forever
40 <SEP> right, it's hard to imagine there was a time before you when you're little
40 <SEP> better cherish the time that you have with him until he goes off to college, but know that he'll always appreciate you.
40 <SEP> 90s music was great.
40 <SEP> oh i have had that happen before.
40 <SEP> yea and i didnt have to go to work!
40 <SEP> i can't imagine what that was like.
40 <SEP> i wish we could atleast have 1 day a year like that but to actually feel as free as them!
40 <SEP> i just read that youth was wasted on the young.
40 <SEP> they can make memories just like you did.
40 <SEP> i do like them but i haven't been on that many, unfortunately.
40 <SEP> you are lucky to have had such a loving grandpa!
40 <SEP> my childhood memory was a great part of our life
40 <SEP> i wish i had parents to do that with.
40 <SEP> i never did anything that daring!
40 <SEP> oh what was was that fantacy
40 <SEP> but it's better to make a good friend then many that aren't that good.
40 <SEP> i'm sure they were, i can barely afford to survive.
40 <SEP> my husband had a 1960 ford f150 he completely redid.
40 <SEP> it was quite an attraction around town!
40 <SEP> oh yea, that movie was one of my favorites when i was a child
40 <SEP> were they family pictures
40 <SEP> i did one enlistment in the military after high school, and now i am in college.
40 <SEP> mine got closed after a scandal that was on netflix
40 <SEP> and what movie did you guys see
40 <SEP> i lived in an apartment complex and there was a pool, so i loved swimming.
40 <SEP> i heard once to make them taste like a professional made it, you just add like extra eggs and sugar and butter or something
40 <SEP> ah i was never much of a sports guy, but i do work out a lot.
40 <SEP> haha i wish it was that simple
40 <SEP> those were the best!
40 <SEP> i can sometimes remember where i was the first time ive seen some to.
40 <SEP> my favorite was flashlight tag.
40 <SEP> ghost in the graveyard was a blast!
40 <SEP> smh time flies now that you mention it...i was just going through old fb beach pics of me and an ex i was planning to marry but we fell off and it hits me like a sucker punch every time
40 <SEP> but i am very eager to go there
40 <SEP> i was just saying the same thing.
40 <SEP> i was just talking about that with my friends.
40 <SEP> i used to love bonfires back in my day those were the days.
40 <SEP> i don't remember a time when it was that cheap anywhere in the world
40 <SEP> those were the days.
40 <SEP> streets of rage was my favorite game
40 <SEP> i just miss the energy i had from when i was younger.
40 <SEP> love was so innocent back then.
40 <SEP> thats a shame they were one of the first stores i remember.
40 <SEP> i wish i still enjoyed them as much as i did way back then.
40 <SEP> i can imagine because becoming a mother was the best time in my life!
40 <SEP> i used to have the dvd but i sold all of the to upgrade to bluray.
40 <SEP> not those that were distressing
40 <SEP> i bet it did!
40 <SEP> i bet you didn't enjoy it back then
40 <SEP> summer vacations were the best
40 <SEP> i remind me when i was kid.
40 <SEP> i've never been myself, but i've always wanted to
40 <SEP> being a kid was so easy.
40 <SEP> 90s were good time.
40 <SEP> my best friend actually moved to korea when i was 13.
40 <SEP> aw, my mom had some she showed to us a few years back.
40 <SEP> those were the days, my friend.
40 <SEP> not much, but it has killer gas mileage.
40 <SEP> i thought they were so much better that nsync too lol
40 <SEP> hope they were bad ones
40 <SEP> my sister is actually pregnant right now but, i'm not supposed to know about that yet.
40 <SEP> if they were good memories.
40 <SEP> yep, childhood was the best time.
40 <SEP> or were they just better concealed
40 <SEP> i feel like that was true in your world.
40 <SEP> but as far as i knew the world was a living hell for colored people more so then than now...but i'm positive the news today only highlights what is convenient for corporate america
40 <SEP> i did the same thing not too long ago when i was in the area i grew up in.
40 <SEP> i was miserable as a kid.
40 <SEP> i moved far from it but if i come back i will visit
40 <SEP> those were the good times, now kids just want to be on their phones
40 <SEP> but he had a stroke in his 40s, and was never in good enough health to do it with me.
40 <SEP> that and i was kind of shy and introverted, so i never made friends to do it with, either.
40 <SEP> but i had no idea there was a game!
40 <SEP> but everyone wishes to do so.
40 <SEP> it was the best feeling in the world eating it.
40 <SEP> used to love that when i was little.
40 <SEP> those were the days.
40 <SEP> it seems cliche to say they were simpler times because i remember them saying that back then about when they were younger.
40 <SEP> i have never actually had one of those!
40 <SEP> never had sunflower seeds.
40 <SEP> legos was one of my favorite games, when i was a kid
40 <SEP> 4 is still a baby for me...but i'd start treating him like a man
40 <SEP> i did too.
40 <SEP> it was partly why my dad had a stroke and then had health problems the rest of his life.
40 <SEP> but i'm sure you get that all the time.
40 <SEP> was it an accident
40 <SEP> it was just an accident.
40 <SEP> i too have had some not so good feelings lately ;(
40 <SEP> i get that, but it was bound to happn at some point
40 <SEP> i think we all did lol
40 <SEP> that had to be a long time ago
40 <SEP> i voted for hillary, i knew trump wasn't going to be worth anything.
40 <SEP> you need to tell them what you did
40 <SEP> it is very hard to lose a loved one but treasure the memories of that person, especially the good memories.
40 <SEP> i thought it was before he got a chance to blow out the candles
40 <SEP> i've had those days before.
40 <SEP> i guess that means they were good at least
40 <SEP> but now i'm trying to be the best version of myself so i can eventually pay them back
40 <SEP> atleast they didnt see you!
40 <SEP> but hey, we make mistakes.
40 <SEP> it is a tough decision for sure, but you should never have to feel bad about it.
40 <SEP> i hear you on that, but the way it is right now, everything we do is destroying the environment, and i'm sure you do plenty already to help.
40 <SEP> it was the homeless guys last day
40 <SEP> but it beats eating vegetables 1 by 1 because that takes forever
40 <SEP> it took me 6 years to find someone after my last relationship, but it happened.
40 <SEP> its okay, it was just an accident.
40 <SEP> its okay, you were young
40 <SEP> but don't feel bad sometimes you have to indulge, and i would figure you still left her some.
40 <SEP> everyone gets sick every once in a while and i would hope that your boss and coworkers were very understanding of your needs.
40 <SEP> i have never had any.
40 <SEP> well, its good that you realize it was a bad action.
40 <SEP> i wish i had your determination!
40 <SEP> i was late for work
40 <SEP> that is not good but my mistake happened.
40 <SEP> luckily nothing happened, but better to be safe while driving.
40 <SEP> were they growing out of them/
40 <SEP> yep that happens lots of times but, i don't think we're supposed to talk about the elephant in the room per the instructions..
40 <SEP> that's a tough decision to make, but children do need someone at that young an age.
40 <SEP> oh what were they doing to you
40 <SEP> ah okay, that makes sense, at least it was sort of legal!
40 <SEP> well they can be, but make sure you buy it next time.
40 <SEP> at least it was a cousin and not a sibling.
40 <SEP> i'd just tell your friend directly that you weren't feeling up to it.
40 <SEP> oh no, did you ever get caught
40 <SEP> sometimes we do things that we don't regret at the moment but do later on down the road.
40 <SEP> tell him you had to go to the store!
40 <SEP> hope it wasn't too expensive!
40 <SEP> well, as long as you did and the wife doesn't know, you're in the clear!
40 <SEP> i would feel bad to but save up some cash put it back and bring it back.
40 <SEP> but you know, it's good that you recognize that you need to change a behavior.
40 <SEP> if you hadn't eaten it the child most likely wouldn't have wanted it.
40 <SEP> it just take a lot of practice, but you will get there!
40 <SEP> at least he didnt hit you
40 <SEP> today was her birthday..but i thought it would be awkward to go over since she blocked me on facebook
40 <SEP> well it was there for you.
40 <SEP> i had to learn how to cook for myself so i could afford to live.
40 <SEP> huge money saver, but i'm sure you already knew that.
40 <SEP> well, that was a long time ago, i don't think you need to carry it around with you anymore, unless you're still doing it.
40 <SEP> that was probably a good idea
40 <SEP> but you may want to have the money to give back to him first.
40 <SEP> but you know your brother better than me.
40 <SEP> but you shouldn't feel bad.
40 <SEP> she gets bumped and scraped way more than my son, but she just goes right on.
40 <SEP> you could have still eaten it if you were daring.
40 <SEP> that was pretty crappy.
40 <SEP> you've had enough.
40 <SEP> well i had to call my landlord once to get back in my place.
40 <SEP> then it was your lucky day.
40 <SEP> oh no that's too bad, it wasn't your fault at least.
40 <SEP> probably didn't last too long when you got back though i'm guessing
40 <SEP> i once blamed my dog for breaking a friend's tv, but it was me
40 <SEP> well, you should.you did a nasty thing.
40 <SEP> i am sure you felt bad, but your son probably understood.
40 <SEP> i thought it was something serious
40 <SEP> makes sense, it's hard to bring things like that up with friends, but if you explain your feelings to them, i'm sure they'll understand.
40 <SEP> i havent had that is years
40 <SEP> you tried at least and your intentions were good.
40 <SEP> haha, was that intentional to get revenge on him/her.
40 <SEP> it was an accident.
40 <SEP> probably not, but i don't remember.
40 <SEP> its not like you cheated on your spouse or did something severe!
40 <SEP> everyone believes that of course, but i believe you, people make mistakes
40 <SEP> it was a long time ago, but i still remember it well.
40 <SEP> but next time you;ll be more aware
40 <SEP> but, at least you realized your mistake.
40 <SEP> i hadn't realized it was carpet.
40 <SEP> you had better sleep with one eye open
40 <SEP> it's not quite the same, but i've felt similarly when i couldn't get previous ex-girlfriends gifts during holidays or their birthdays or something.
40 <SEP> but i'm sure she knows you love her anyway.
40 <SEP> i'm sure you had a good reason.
40 <SEP> but you probably know that.
40 <SEP> that's good that your friend wasn't affected by your actions too badly.
40 <SEP> if you guys moved on from it then it was a great learning opportunity!
40 <SEP> we were going through the same type of thing for about a year.
40 <SEP> i think you risk not building social ties with your coworkers but sometimes you have no choice.
40 <SEP> i get that i guess, but that is life sometimes
40 <SEP> it was wrong of course.
40 <SEP> i think you do but sometimes we have to do hard things in life.
40 <SEP> my mother was like that as well.
40 <SEP> i sure hope the hot dog was fit to eat
40 <SEP> oh, you shouldn't feel bad about it, i'm sure it was fine to eat!
40 <SEP> it wasn't intentional ....still a horrible feeling
40 <SEP> it was speeding, but at least it wasn't wreckless driving!
40 <SEP> check to see if your friend had it microchipped.
40 <SEP> i get that, but money talks at the end of the day
40 <SEP> i did that too!
40 <SEP> i remember it was a package of big league chew.
40 <SEP> my mom took me back to the store and made me talk to the manager.
40 <SEP> i'm not sure what 5 is, but it's a good story to tell your kids if you have any.
40 <SEP> it's great that you both were able to work it out.
40 <SEP> if i had an accident like that i wouldnt be able to pay either.
40 <SEP> usually, i advocate honesty, but don't know enough about your situation to advise.
40 <SEP> we may not be able to help them in the way we want to all the time but i am sure your mom knows you care a lot.
40 <SEP> well what he didn't know won't hurt him.
40 <SEP> but it was an accident on your part so dont feel so bad about it
40 <SEP> i don't think i have ever remembered a single friends birthday until facebook was created.
40 <SEP> well, that was terrible of you.
40 <SEP> that isn't half as bad as what i was thinking it might be.
40 <SEP> i have never had an accident.
40 <SEP> it was a korean movie.
40 <SEP> it's not fair - but i suppose the opposite view is that if they make enough money then you don't need the support that otehr people do.
40 <SEP> but hey, to each his own!
40 <SEP> i'm not sure, but i'm not liking where society is heading these days.
40 <SEP> it is i have had that happen with 2 of my cards and my debit card.
40 <SEP> i've heard of oral fixations before, but only in the context of like chewing fingernails and smoking cigarettes, etc.
40 <SEP> but i guess if i think about it, a lot of people chew fingernails, and i'm sure that's just as bad bacteria-wise.
40 <SEP> i would just take an uber from now on if i were you.
40 <SEP> im sure they were very grateful for your help!
40 <SEP> i can only imagine that, i have never had it and never want to!
40 <SEP> i would like to think that i wouldn't but if it were that or die, i'd eat.
40 <SEP> well, i guess i was wrong then :p
40 <SEP> but i guess we're the people that eat it up and make them do that.
40 <SEP> well that's good they yall still had cake.
40 <SEP> i can imagine it was horrifying for you.
40 <SEP> oh i didn't know about that.
40 <SEP> who knows, that's a waste of a good sandwich though!
40 <SEP> he should have stayed on his own stairs if he was going to make a mess like that!
40 <SEP> i'm sure it was awful at the time, but it'll be a good story when he grows up!
40 <SEP> that game was suprising.
40 <SEP> i'm clean, but i'm stuck with a dirty roommate who doesn't do dishes.
40 <SEP> i bet, i wish some people had better manners.
40 <SEP> they will do that, but sure don't want puppy kisses later.
40 <SEP> i'm sure it was!
40 <SEP> so you had chocolate covered ants!
40 <SEP> ugh, i did the same thing today!
40 <SEP> i had been through such experience and know how more difficulty he can bring.
40 <SEP> i've had injuries before and they weren't serious enough or worth the hassle of the emergency room.
40 <SEP> but he still had to take a trip to go somewhere.
40 <SEP> at least you can say you didn't chicken out.
40 <SEP> that's good but should also be standard for any hotel, nevertheless a 5 star one.
40 <SEP> lol brothers.. mine was the same when we were little
40 <SEP> i am sure it wasnt
40 <SEP> but you survived.
40 <SEP> i had to buy a fruit fly trap this summer as well.
40 <SEP> but as soon as i set it up they stopped flying around.
40 <SEP> hmm did you try calling pest control
40 <SEP> or were you just traumatized haha
40 <SEP> that is nasty i dont own pets at all but i can imagine your situation
40 <SEP> that was very generous of you.
40 <SEP> oh my lord,  how long to you think it had been there
40 <SEP> from what you have told i cant go there what else did you see
40 <SEP> and it's one thing if they're only affecting themselves -- but when it's aimed at others -- the worst.
40 <SEP> eww, i've had that happen.
40 <SEP> i've never been in one, but i always assumed they were cleaner!
40 <SEP> that's always so annoying, especially when they overeat and waste food.
40 <SEP> it's true, but i also can't help but watch.
40 <SEP> growing up i had to take ours down our steep driveway every week.
40 <SEP> would have drove that car straight through the car wash.
40 <SEP> oh i was confused.
40 <SEP> sometimes things like this do happen, but it is not something you like to see!
40 <SEP> i think i'd look into entering some eating contests if i were you!
40 <SEP> at least it wasnt in your house.
40 <SEP> woah, i never had that happen to me.
40 <SEP> i would be trying to find another place if i were you, or tell him to find one!
40 <SEP> that is nasty, but some people just do not care
40 <SEP> it would be bad enough it was just spit, but the tobacco amps it up to 11.
40 <SEP> i don't blame you, but we have to help our struggling siblings out!
40 <SEP> i have had that happen to me many times.
40 <SEP> i don't know if i could even eat a squid if it was fully cooked
40 <SEP> but america is so great now!
40 <SEP> i spoke to someone who had seen a show about a guy eating a live squid.
40 <SEP> you may have to wash your car to get that smell out!
40 <SEP> you have to find the person who did this.then you should made the mess to clean it up
40 <SEP> i've had hundreds.
40 <SEP> im skinny, but i love food
40 <SEP> i  always try to remember how long stuff has been in there, but sometimes things hide on you in there.
40 <SEP> that makes me want to not eat there anymore, but i guess it happens sometimes.
40 <SEP> i have never had taco bell breakfast.
40 <SEP> hey well at least they didn't do too bad last year
40 <SEP> better than nothing but still no patty melt!
40 <SEP> you should thrash in the waste bin
40 <SEP> oh ok, that good you took safety precaution and others from getting harm by doing that, welldone
40 <SEP> i have never had that.
40 <SEP> i don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing, but either way it is epic.
40 <SEP> it is hard to recover from a binge like that, but do a few thousand situps and you'll be good as new!
40 <SEP> it was probably harder to get off too
40 <SEP> it is very difficult, but i've see marriages recover from that position - but it takes years to build up that trust again properly.
40 <SEP> i boarded a flight to my destination, while on board i requested a particular drink ,and it was declined
40 <SEP> :o uhhh oh you had to pick them off
40 <SEP> hope you didn't take a bath after that
40 <SEP> poor skunk didn't know what hit him.
40 <SEP> interesting...you sure it wasn't fish that washed up on the shore
40 <SEP> gotcha..hope that didn't ruin your whole day
40 <SEP> i've never had the guts to do that, even though i've wanted to on multiple occasions.
40 <SEP> so it wasn't even just taste, it was about health.. dang.
40 <SEP> makes me feel like whoever prepared my food was not very clean.
40 <SEP> i did one of those with my wife last year and it was a blast.
40 <SEP> unless he was hot...
40 <SEP> my teacher had us dissect fish as well and i prefere that much more for some reason
40 <SEP> i've had to change the diapers of my nieces and nephews for the past 15 years, as they've come and gone.
40 <SEP> but i imagine he will come around
40 <SEP> i did that 32 years ago in high school.
40 <SEP> but if it was free, i guess that's a good thing.
40 <SEP> that literally makes no sense like i get it you are homeless but no reason to be dirty!
40 <SEP> lol hey at least it was your neighbors sidewalk and not yours
40 <SEP> for sure but no relationship is perfect and everything takes work
40 <SEP> but at least you were able to extract the hair!
40 <SEP> that happened to me at work when i was pregnant, too.
40 <SEP> except for me, it was curry.
40 <SEP> oh no what did you do
40 <SEP> that happened to me and i had to stop watching them.
40 <SEP> it can help, but i could not watch it...
40 <SEP> he had a good amount of time to recuperate.
40 <SEP> i'm just a plain salad person, but i do like my bacon bits and croutons in a salad.
40 <SEP> mine is the same way but there is one piece of furniture he just insists on ruining.
40 <SEP> yep, thats what i did with the chair mine messed up pretty bad.
40 <SEP> was it a long wait
40 <SEP> oh that's the worst, i try to remember to charge but it's hard to remember every time.
40 <SEP> i dunno if i'd go quite that far, but you do you :p
40 <SEP> i couldn't imagine what i would do if i had my child ripped from me
40 <SEP> you are very lucky you didn't crash your car while driving.
40 <SEP> that stinks but i guess the law is the law.
40 <SEP> but it will fade over time.
40 <SEP> i was always taught the importance of using my signals.
40 <SEP> too bad about your car but the main thing is that you were not injured.
40 <SEP> i'd give the power company a call and see if there wasn't a mistake.
40 <SEP> i'm not a parent, but i have siblings who have done the same (and of course i've done it to my parents, too).
40 <SEP> that actually happened to me but thankfully it was an old account that i didn't use.
40 <SEP> (not that you want them to....i just imagine they'd be pretty devastated to know that's why a holiday was ruined for you.)
40 <SEP> i bet people have had those stuck in their feet before
40 <SEP> i'd rather just have company while i did the work
40 <SEP> i have never had siblings, so not sure what to tell ya.
40 <SEP> can you find out who it was.
40 <SEP> i'd be whooping somebody if i found out who did it!
40 <SEP> brothers always seem to want to get into fights with one another, but at the end of the day, i'm sure you guys love each other very much!
40 <SEP> he probably had no where to go important.
40 <SEP> he was just being rude.
40 <SEP> but the bright side is, if you have two days worth of fall or winter, she's prepared!
40 <SEP> i let my kids use my computer too but always say, no drinks by it and wash your hands.
40 <SEP> it is a hard balance because they need to learn and it should make you mad, but people do make mistakes.
40 <SEP> i will go out on a limb and say she didn't hold up her end, hope you get your garden back bright and beautiful
40 <SEP> mine hadn't been replaced in 6 years, i found that out after the fact.
40 <SEP> i thought kids didn't do that anymore
40 <SEP> were were all comic villains last year
40 <SEP> and i bet they just drove off and didn't even leave a note.
40 <SEP> that was probably a good idea.
40 <SEP> but still, i think homework is a little excessive.
40 <SEP> thats good, my house was also broken in to
40 <SEP> oh no, did you get them back
40 <SEP> at least you did the right thing and didn't yell at the kid yourself.
40 <SEP> i used to have a dog years ago and have had that happen too.
40 <SEP> i had no idea, since i've never used them.
40 <SEP> but then i'm a little on the vindictive side, lol!
40 <SEP> they did!
40 <SEP> i'd like to think they were having trouble dealing with it themselves and that's why they didn't tell you right away.
40 <SEP> i had a car stolen once while i was at work.
40 <SEP> i had just soent over 1500 getting things fixed on it.
40 <SEP> we should stake out in the bushes out there and see who it was!
40 <SEP> that's terrible, but good for you for having a plan.
40 <SEP> well, at least you followed the law and didn't end up running a red light.
40 <SEP> damn was it a bogus call or what
40 <SEP> we hang out now and again, but there are others i'd rather spend my time with.
40 <SEP> but you have to do it otherwise you wont be able to trust her.
40 <SEP> ah man i could imagine, especially if they didnt stay and let you know
40 <SEP> he had better apologize.
40 <SEP> i'm sure your work will understand, but it's still a crummy situation that is probably affecting all areas of your life.
40 <SEP> at least they were responsible enough to that with you.
40 <SEP> i always did that as a kid.
40 <SEP> i probably would have tried to shoot him thinking he was an intruder
40 <SEP> well that's good, at least he didn't do it on purpose.
40 <SEP> well she was just rude then.
40 <SEP> i wish i had a car.
40 <SEP> if i had a chance to rescue an animal, i would totally do it.
40 <SEP> i'm sure it was a challenge getting him back home, at least you got some exercise haha
40 <SEP> i'd get upset if it were me.
40 <SEP> but kids will be busy.
40 <SEP> yup, but what i don't like about that age is having to stay up all night!
40 <SEP> know how fustrating that can be, hope there wasn't much damage.
40 <SEP> im sure it was an accident.
40 <SEP> you cant go back into the past, but you can keep moving forward
40 <SEP> oh no, i've never had a cat because my husband and brother are allergic.
40 <SEP> they just pretend like they weren't acting like a jerk.
40 <SEP> it can take forever but never lasts long enough
40 <SEP> i am sure your mom was keeping a good eye on the child.
40 <SEP> i have had that happen a few times.
40 <SEP> i had to pick mine up at the animal shelter.
40 <SEP> i guess that makes sense but still.
40 <SEP> a store employee once told me they had to keep certain things by the checkout or they walked!
40 <SEP> i got caught (when i was about 8) bouncing a ping pong ball while leaving a toy store.
40 <SEP> the owner took me home and my dad gave me a hiding.
40 <SEP> while other teenagers were thieving i was being a very good little girl!
40 <SEP> good to hear you were all right.
40 <SEP> you should put a can outside with a big sign that says "throw your nasty butts here"
40 <SEP> i was the same way.
40 <SEP> well at least you found out it was just user error and not that he was actually better than you!
40 <SEP> that was rude of them.
40 <SEP> good, did he actually come back with it though.
40 <SEP> i had to go that route once.
40 <SEP> i literally had to have my truck towed to  the dealership.
40 <SEP> at least you didn't get fired
40 <SEP> oh man i would be so mad...did he apologize at all
40 <SEP> i had one job where i spent all day either playing cards or working online, just to relieve the boredom!
40 <SEP> my phone was a help to play online games if i was totally losing it!
40 <SEP> wht did you do
40 <SEP> oh no that was bad
40 <SEP> i was thinking that.
40 <SEP> ah i've never read it before, i was hoping it would have been one i'm familiar with.
40 <SEP> hmmm but why did you go 1 mile over/
40 <SEP> thats unfortunate, the bright side is that it wasnt stolen and the car is still in good working condition
40 <SEP> he didn't punish you... he punished himself!
40 <SEP> i'm impressed you didn't explode!
40 <SEP> then i noticed that i caught up with him because he got stuck at a light and all that craziness didn't even help him.
40 <SEP> i wish we had cctv cameras everywhere like they do in the uk
40 <SEP> it was frustrating for her for a while, but things are looking up for her!
40 <SEP> and they always get nasty with you like it was your fault and not theirs!
40 <SEP> that was very mean of him.
40 <SEP> that was rude.
40 <SEP> i suggest you just ask them why they didn't invite you straight up.
40 <SEP> accidents happen but come on pick them up.
40 <SEP> were able to save any of it
40 <SEP> i don't think i've ever had a honey bun...
40 <SEP> my day was pretty good.
40 <SEP> i  didn't know she hurt your feelings.
40 <SEP> if i were your co-worker and you told me that, i'd lend you at least a couple bucks for the vending machines or something.
40 <SEP> that was a wise thing you did!
40 <SEP> that was back then when he was trying to do something great, the drive isnt there when you have already done it
40 <SEP> at least if it does happen again, it won't get into the mattress and you can wash the rest of the bed clothes.
40 <SEP> i didn't know shoes could cost that much!
40 <SEP> at least it wasn't a full on accident where you could've gotten injured.
40 <SEP> oh, i thought it was a t a restaurant.
40 <SEP> tell your chief it was your assistant who did it
40 <SEP> they can be selfish sometimes, but we just have to remember that they have developed the parts of their brain to make them care about more than just themselves.
40 <SEP> ... and i bet they didn't even leave a note or anything.
40 <SEP> but forgive her and let her make it up to you.
40 <SEP> it's good to hear that your experience was fulfilling.
40 <SEP> if only people were more considerate of others.
40 <SEP> especially since it was the whole day.
40 <SEP> well, it is good that you did not marry him.
40 <SEP> i had a husband who cheated.
40 <SEP> its frusterating, especially when it was an important conversation.
40 <SEP> it was just a tire he couldve let it go.
40 <SEP> hope it wasn't too bad!
40 <SEP> not that it makes it any better, but at least you're not alone.
40 <SEP> i guess he has no care for anyone but himself
40 <SEP> one time i secretly called my boss's wife and outted him for an affair he was having with one of my coworkers.. lol he never knew..
40 <SEP> that is good that the person was courteous.
40 <SEP> i had someone dent my car too last week.
40 <SEP> but it came with some perks i guess.
40 <SEP> probably would if it weren't for fights over dumb things.
40 <SEP> i think you'll probably be fine but, that dosen't mean your lunch isn't ruined.
40 <SEP> i like cats, but not the mean ones, only the sweet ones.
40 <SEP> at least you didn't get into an accident.
40 <SEP> that was so irresponsible of them!
40 <SEP> i actually liked retail but the customers and the schedule sucks lol
40 <SEP> but most people are still faithful in their relationship
40 <SEP> but one closed door leads to the next great opportunity.
40 <SEP> ive only been once but it was great.
40 <SEP> but i hold my tongue
40 <SEP> we have cat scratching posts everywhere to try to avoid that, but still had to put the sticky tape on the couch to prevent scratching
40 <SEP> cats are always getting into things they shouldn't, but i still love them
40 <SEP> that was rude.
40 <SEP> thats ok.  ugg...that had to be annoying.
40 <SEP> but more than likely she will move in with my family
40 <SEP> i would ask you if they are compensating you for overtime but if they're already treating you like this, then i doubt it.
40 <SEP> i have that happen all the time but with onions.
40 <SEP> i didnt even think about that.
40 <SEP> no, he lowered my taxes.
40 <SEP> but still if she is only using you i dont think she is some one you need to be around just saying
40 <SEP> that was a good move
40 <SEP> i've never had a dog
40 <SEP> probably would have gotten out and throat punched them if they had hit me!
40 <SEP> i bet it did!
40 <SEP> if people were just more considerate of the other people around them...
40 <SEP> they didn't even eat it!
40 <SEP> i wish  i had one.
40 <SEP> that was rude of them.
40 <SEP> we are all born with brains but not smarts.
40 <SEP> i'm sure that was disappointing after putting in so many years.
40 <SEP> who did he bit
40 <SEP> that is what my mom did when i was a kid.
40 <SEP> i would had the same reaction.
40 <SEP> my mom had that happen too- an old guy hit her atthe gas station and sped off!
40 <SEP> oh yea, i've had it happen a few times.
40 <SEP> no he didn't.. but at least they were admitting they were assholes, you didn't have to wait till you were older to figure it out.
40 <SEP> but still, it doesn't take much effort to try to keep the noise down even if you do get in late!
40 <SEP> but now you have a repair bill.
40 <SEP> were they on the phone
40 <SEP> and at least they didn't try to bust into your home and harm you.
40 <SEP> i did too, honestly.
40 <SEP> my ex's brother did that bother and i quickly nipped that behavior in the bud.
40 <SEP> that is okay then, but still anoying
40 <SEP> haha that was serious
40 <SEP> my parents usually did that do.
40 <SEP> but i imagine you guys were pretty mad during to break out into a fist fight.
40 <SEP> i'm sure it didn't do it on purpose
40 <SEP> i can't believe they didn't alert you.
40 <SEP> yea i can believe it.. but it makes you feel better!
40 <SEP> that was a crappy thing to do.
40 <SEP> they probably deserve it but you know the old saying two wrongs don't make a right.
40 <SEP> thanks that was very helpful.
40 <SEP> you did right
40 <SEP> i would not want to be in your position it's ok to help but all the time it can be dreadful.
40 <SEP> its hard being a parent... but i am sure you are doing it right!
40 <SEP> oh i didn't realize your brother had control of it because he slept there.
40 <SEP> i had an apartment with limited parking and people that didn't live there always parked there anyway.
40 <SEP> it would have sucked more if it was raining.
40 <SEP> i wish public transportation was better in the city.
40 <SEP> it is a rare trait, but there are few people who do better on tasks on their own than as group task.
40 <SEP> or does not contribute as much like they should, i.e., critical thinking/participatory contributions
40 <SEP> that is awful, why did he do that
40 <SEP> they were trying to butter you up before you saw what they did!
40 <SEP> i've had that happen.
40 <SEP> you love them but sometimes they can be such a pain!
40 <SEP> in my case it was a dog, i caught him on camera!
40 <SEP> you should've called the police if they didn't listen to you
40 <SEP> my mother used to do that when i was young.
40 <SEP> oh, i bet that did irritate you!
40 <SEP> it's bad enough moving, but you don't need your furniture falling apart on you.
40 <SEP> i had a similar situation happen over christmas.
40 <SEP> it's too bad it wasn't something you bought with a credit card and could just dispute it..
40 <SEP> i've had that happen to me before!
40 <SEP> i don't have a sister but i wouldn't want my things taken.
40 <SEP> its hard to refuse family,  but sometimes that can be taken advantage of.
40 <SEP> i've always wanted to but never have.
40 <SEP> i did a long time ago.
40 <SEP> but i guess we can never be mad at our pets huh
40 <SEP> i wasn't thinking at 18 years old, i didn't understand the amount.
40 <SEP> yep, but you can only help one person at a time.
40 <SEP> but it's an important part of the socializing part of life that they work their way through it.
40 <SEP> but it's another if you think it's neglect and that they're not responding appropriately to the situation.
40 <SEP> i've had many coworkers like that, and the best way i've found to deal with them is run away as much as possible.
40 <SEP> that was a good solution!
40 <SEP> but, it won't do much if the isp isn't good to begin with.
40 <SEP> it took mine a year and a half before they weren't having any more accidents like that.
40 <SEP> but hey, at least you live near a beach.
40 <SEP> i thought they were not supposed to be allowed to call anymore.
40 <SEP> i thought the 7 hour drives we did with 3 of us were awful.
40 <SEP> but, as you said it's over so life goes on :}
40 <SEP> mine was up extra late tonight too.
40 <SEP> but i eat slow.
40 <SEP> i just cannot understand why people won't do their job properly, i had to cut my lunch break in order to do more work
40 <SEP> o no did you report it to the hospital
40 <SEP> i didn't have that problem in mexico
40 <SEP> it was two years ago.
40 <SEP> was it a new rug
40 <SEP> she was probably doing it on purpose to annoy you!
40 <SEP> i believe that was me
40 <SEP> it was like monsoon weather here too.
40 <SEP> i would take another dose if i were you.
40 <SEP> i do too, but seems like most people are like that nowadays
40 <SEP> i would be mad, we had that problem all the time at the last place we lived.
40 <SEP> that's such an awkward situation, because you don't want to come off as high maintenance and ask them to stop, but it'd be so easy for them to have better manners, too.
40 <SEP> i wish i had better advice.
40 <SEP> but i'm sure you've tried that.
40 <SEP> who knows how they would respond if you asked them personally, and if they actually did improve, they'd probably just forget and revert back in a few days anyway.
40 <SEP> as a matter of fact my friend asked me help him move recently , but i was busy at work too he understood
40 <SEP> we cant win them all , but work always comes first
40 <SEP> i'm not sure that's healthy, but it's also not my business.
40 <SEP> i am all about keeping the earth clean, recycling, and low waste living.
40 <SEP> i did when i was a child!
40 <SEP> that makes sense, but i guess everyone needs food!
40 <SEP> i set the clocks ahead in the house and in the car .. it doesnt work all the time but it helps
40 <SEP> nothing seems to for sure keep those things away but the bites are the worst.
40 <SEP> i get that, i have had jobs like that, some people just thrive on drama, they do not enjoy anything more than that
40 <SEP> i wish we didnt have to pay so much to keep ourselves healthy
40 <SEP> yikes, i had when that happens.
40 <SEP> i have had that happen before and it is super annoying!
40 <SEP> i can deal with dogs barking during the day but at night is no good.
40 <SEP> that is true about the waste.
40 <SEP> at lease it wasn't a power outage though.
40 <SEP> it's like 100 degrees during the day, you would have had to find a pool to jump in.
40 <SEP> i used to have a pit bull who was a sweetheart!
40 <SEP> was the dog okay
40 <SEP> people always give others crap about staring at them all day, but it's because they afford us the ability to do so many things.
40 <SEP> i even talked to them several times but they don't care
40 <SEP> if i was in a higher class i'd of straight told them to quiet down.
40 <SEP> man... its been a long time but, i remember those days.
40 <SEP> no one knows how to push your buttons like family.
40 <SEP> i get why they don't let you get your own beverages but at the same time it seems unnecessary to have to wait for someone to refill your glass.
40 <SEP> hahah i was kind of concerned but didn't want to ask.
40 <SEP> i could be wrong...but i feel like they just miss your company...and are using your grandma as a scapegoat.
40 <SEP> but when they're dead and gone you'll miss the pestering so love them for who they are, you're still free to make your own choices.
40 <SEP> that's the worst, i'm sure it was an annoyance!
40 <SEP> homeless people can be good sometimes but sometimes its just annoying
40 <SEP> if i was you i would write a bad review on this restaurant's facebook page
40 <SEP> i am sure he didn't let you hear the end of that.
40 <SEP> if you were on the other end you wouldn
40 <SEP> you should be able to trust that he won't do anything shady when he talks to other girls.
40 <SEP> but now i'm interested to know.
40 <SEP> i've never had a pair either - but i don't despise them.
40 <SEP> if you did it that time, you can do it again.
40 <SEP> my brother did too!
40 <SEP> that was some bonus.
40 <SEP> but she loves you for you and not for what you can afford.
40 <SEP> she did invitro twice.
40 <SEP> the first one didn't work.
40 <SEP> apparently the second one did.... but that's supposed to be a secret for now.
40 <SEP> i'm still friends with my old roommate, but i found other people to spend my time with.
40 <SEP> yea, but i try not to compare.
40 <SEP> i actually dont, my country decided to illegally deny it to me, but most people do.
40 <SEP> its hard to not compare yourself with others but we're all made differently with our own strengths.
40 <SEP> it happens... but you never know their situation and sometimes people make bad financial decisions
40 <SEP> man, i wish i had the money to afford a boat, i don't know about you.
40 <SEP> i wish i had more close friends
40 <SEP> but most times it does not pay to be that way, cause 9 times out of 10 those kind of people is just living off credit so technically it is not something they own out right
40 <SEP> i wish i was chris pratt but why do you wanna be "the pitt"
40 <SEP> this is very true, but would you want to be bugged by people all the time.
40 <SEP> he may have not realized that he was doing that because there may have just been too many people there.
40 <SEP> i feel jealous i didn't get the artistic genes my brother got lol
40 <SEP> not that i think it works, but apparently many people would like to be taller.
40 <SEP> i wish i was one of those people.
40 <SEP> it would be crazy frustrating if you weren't.
40 <SEP> i have had that happen.
40 <SEP> it did not feel good.
40 <SEP> i would settle for a british butler.
40 <SEP> im sure it wasnt easy at the time.
40 <SEP> if i were in your shoes, i could see how you would start to feel some more pressure in that situation.
40 <SEP> i was always the youngest child, so i never had pressure on me to accomplish anything by a certain time.
40 <SEP> but nothing has to be "wrong with you."
40 <SEP> oh well that's too bad but their behavior is not right or fair, and they will deal with the consequences of that themselves.
40 <SEP> i didn't give anyone any money either.
40 <SEP> i wish i was that lucky!
40 <SEP> try not to approach it like that, but do look for the right man.
40 <SEP> i wish i was him too - lol!
40 <SEP> if i were to travel to mars, it would be with him!
40 <SEP> i feel the same sometimes but honestly it's not realistoc
40 <SEP> i wish i had a better computer.
40 <SEP> thats lame, why is work alwasy keeping us from doing what we love.
40 <SEP> sucks, i've had to work under scumbag managment before
40 <SEP> oh that's hard but i'm sure you will get yours too.
40 <SEP> no i can but i didn't want her to have it and not me.
40 <SEP> no i can but i didn't want her to have it and not me.
40 <SEP> it recently did for me.
40 <SEP> he was lucky to find such a great partner!
40 <SEP> haha.. thats hilarious, i thought he was spoiling you!
40 <SEP> stuff like that makes me wonder if they had been talking to each other the whole time
40 <SEP> i was always jealous because my brothers didn't need to work as hard after i moved away.
40 <SEP> i was joking.
40 <SEP> i havent a curfew since i was 17.
40 <SEP> well, if i had enough money, i would travel the whole world.
40 <SEP> but unfortunately, i have to be at work even during summers
40 <SEP> if i were you, i would ask your mom why she paid for your sisters; items and not yours.
40 <SEP> that is good that you trust him, but temptation is never good for anyone.
40 <SEP> right, sometimes i feel the same way when i feel like i should have something, but then i realize i would get bored from it after a while like everything
40 <SEP> we are 10 years apart, but he make a ton more money than, i do.
40 <SEP> you could go on youtube and find tons of videos about flipping homes with no money.. but if your brother has a little change.. well.. go brother!
40 <SEP> if it was meant to be, it would have happened.
40 <SEP> they are, but if you save up a little at a time, it won't be that bad!
40 <SEP> that may be a issue i mean you want to trust\t your significant other but as women we know the changes and signs trust me.
40 <SEP> even if it were wrong, there may be nothing you can do about it.
40 <SEP> but i think there are ways you can take your negative emotions and put a positive spin on them, in order to motivate you in a more healthy, conducive way.
40 <SEP> as long as you trained hard and did your best, that is what counts!
40 <SEP> if she's a good friend, she'll understand and make an effort to make time for you but don't let it make you bitter.
40 <SEP> but i can.
40 <SEP> i mean i would never be able to afford that but if they can then it is nothing for them to do the routine care.
40 <SEP> but, as long as the bills are getting paid, i guess you can't complain.
40 <SEP> but, you can't help stupid people from getting high paying jobs.
40 <SEP> but remember there are always private things.
40 <SEP> i had similar situation with my friend last year
40 <SEP> well that stinks for you but good for him
40 <SEP> height you can not change but if you work hard anyone can be rich.
40 <SEP> i had the same thing happen.
40 <SEP> i wish i was also tall.
40 <SEP> but just remember he loves you and if he's never given you any doubt then trust him
40 <SEP> but its like hands off!
40 <SEP> it took me many years before i learned to have complete faith in my wife.
40 <SEP> i always wish i was good at design.
40 <SEP> i've tried, but i'm pretty garbage, haha!
40 <SEP> thats an unhealthy way to think but its hard to avoid
40 <SEP> i am paying cash for my classes now but i only take 1 at a time.
40 <SEP> i'd be pretty jealous of him if i were you.
40 <SEP> but its what makes us strive to be better!
40 <SEP> you should had planned your vacation together.
40 <SEP> that is probably true, but the stories we hear do not help
40 <SEP> i was a strong swimmer when i was a kid.
