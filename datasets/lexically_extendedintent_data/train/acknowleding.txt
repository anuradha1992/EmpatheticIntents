33 <SEP> i am sorry to hear that, it is pretty embarassing to be in situations like that
33 <SEP> oh my goodness, that must have been humiliating.
33 <SEP> sounds like a good reason to leave maybe i should spill juice on myself too lol

33 <SEP> you must have been pretty embarrassed.
33 <SEP> that's not a very nice policy for a restaurant to have.
33 <SEP> that sounds awful.

33 <SEP> that's pretty heavy.
33 <SEP> that sounds like tragic timing.

33 <SEP> ah that sucks.
33 <SEP> yes i would be too.
33 <SEP> that's pretty cool that you took that route--sometimes i think about the "what if" of if i took that route.
33 <SEP> oh that sucks!
33 <SEP> it will probably be nice to move to a city and get away from those chickens.
33 <SEP> he sounds like a real low life.
33 <SEP> wow that must have been awkward.
33 <SEP> i can see how that would be really annoying.
33 <SEP> i would be too.
33 <SEP> that sounds so sad.
33 <SEP> you must have been rather disappointed.
33 <SEP> omg so gross i would have been so mad where was your cat at the time.

33 <SEP> sounds pretty incompetent to me.
33 <SEP> that sucks!
33 <SEP> i would have been too.. i love my cheese burgers
33 <SEP> that would really make me feel sad , what was the test on
33 <SEP> that's pretty nice that you would help her out like that.
33 <SEP> wow, that would make me mad too.
33 <SEP> oh no, that sounds super annoying!

33 <SEP> that sucks.
33 <SEP> it sounds like an honest mistake.
33 <SEP> oh wow, defenitly sounds like he was too focused on video games.
33 <SEP> that's pretty bleak.
33 <SEP> i would have been!

33 <SEP> hopefully next weekend is nice and sunny for you and your friends!
33 <SEP> oh, that sounds like a hassle.
33 <SEP> oh that's not cool, get a different one.
33 <SEP> sounds like you need a "cat whisperer"!
33 <SEP> it must have been a good play.
33 <SEP> it's pretty hot where i live.
33 <SEP> that sounds awful.
33 <SEP> that sucks, maybe you guys can plan something for another weekend before it gets cold.
33 <SEP> ugh i would be bummed too.
33 <SEP> i bet, its always nice to get a chance to work with someone you really like.
33 <SEP> that sucks.
33 <SEP> wow that sounds like a terrible friend.
33 <SEP> i'm sorry you won't get to see him this weekend - perhaps you can have a nice long phone call or skype or something to catch up until you can see him again.
33 <SEP> oh nice.
33 <SEP> you sound like a hard worker, which is something to be proud of, even though it's kind of wearing you out maybe.
33 <SEP> oh no, that is not cool
33 <SEP> that must have been frustrating.
33 <SEP> that's awesome!

33 <SEP> you are amazing and perfect and awesome!
33 <SEP> that sucks.
33 <SEP> you must have look forwarded to the trip
33 <SEP> i would ask him how it went and casually say "i would have gone had you asked".
33 <SEP> that sounds bad.
33 <SEP> it sounds like you need soe distance from them
33 <SEP> must have been something important come up!
33 <SEP> that has to be really cool.
33 <SEP> that would be a bummer for anyone
33 <SEP> that's awesome!

33 <SEP> that sounds delicious and i'm going to have to try that!
33 <SEP> that must've been very disapointing
33 <SEP> oh man, that sucks.
33 <SEP> that's so nice!
33 <SEP> it's nice when everything turns out great in the end.
33 <SEP> that sucks!
33 <SEP> i bet that is pretty disappointing.
33 <SEP> sounds like you got some nice stuff!
33 <SEP> i bet it was!
33 <SEP> sounds like you had a bad experience.
33 <SEP> i have one and it is awesome
33 <SEP> i would get that a lot in school back in the day i feel it's pretty normal to have those moments.
33 <SEP> ah i see.
33 <SEP> must have slipped his mind while he was hard at work.
33 <SEP> i would have told her to fill out the paperwork herself getting your hopes up like that.
33 <SEP> that would make anyone upset!
33 <SEP> that sounds exciting!
33 <SEP> i'm sure you'll meet some cool people if you find a good pho restaurant!
33 <SEP> that's cool.
33 <SEP> that sounds like fun.
33 <SEP> i can understand my work does not allow me to do much as well
33 <SEP> that could be kind of scary.
33 <SEP> i feel you.

33 <SEP> that's so nice!
33 <SEP> he sounds like a keeper!
33 <SEP> he sounds like a nice guy.
33 <SEP> that sounds so sad.
33 <SEP> i can understand that - unfortunately some times we have to do those annoying things in order to keep things level.
33 <SEP> awesome!
33 <SEP> that would be hard.
33 <SEP> oh thats cool
33 <SEP> i imagine that must have been quite a lonely experience for you.

33 <SEP> that sounds rough.
33 <SEP> that's pretty nice.
33 <SEP> with that kind of experience, it sounds like it could be a good friend for life.
33 <SEP> dont take it in a bad way im sure its been real nice being alone.
33 <SEP> they seem like not very nice people!
33 <SEP> i dont have kids either, sometimes when i go out with my friends im mainly the 3rd wheel and it feels weird , i feel your pain
33 <SEP> sounds pretty scary!
33 <SEP> you must have felt very lonely.
33 <SEP> that is a nice thing you are doing for her though.
33 <SEP> ohhh, i feel you.
33 <SEP> that's pretty impressive!
33 <SEP> that sucks!
33 <SEP> that sucks.
33 <SEP> there's plenty of nice and kind people in the world.

33 <SEP> that must have been really hard on you.
33 <SEP> that's great!
33 <SEP> yes, you have overcome a lot it sounds like!
33 <SEP> all you must have been proud of yourself
33 <SEP> you may try talking to her or taking her out for a nice, quiet dinner.
33 <SEP> that sucks.
33 <SEP> that is nice!
33 <SEP> that must have been lonely.
33 <SEP> that sucks.

33 <SEP> in the medical clinic i bet quiet nights were ok.
33 <SEP> it sounds like you're doing better though :)
33 <SEP> that's great to hear!
33 <SEP> i would be too!
33 <SEP> that does sound lonely.
33 <SEP> if you can find a hobby to occupy those evenings that would be best.
33 <SEP> that sounds horribly boring.
33 <SEP> i can understand that.
33 <SEP> get out and meet some cool people (easier said than done, i know).
33 <SEP> nice.
33 <SEP> oh that sounds very exotic
33 <SEP> i see, being alone can be fulfilling to.
33 <SEP> that's great!
33 <SEP> that sounds lonely.
33 <SEP> that's not cool, i hope you find someone new.
33 <SEP> that's great!
33 <SEP> he sounds like a bad influence
33 <SEP> that must be a cool bar to let pets in.
33 <SEP> that sucks!
33 <SEP> you could've always come on here and chat with other cool people like you :d
33 <SEP> it sounds like you need some knew people to surround you
33 <SEP> that does sound like a troubling situation.
33 <SEP> oh, i see.
33 <SEP> oh that's cool.
33 <SEP> sounds like he's living the dream lol
33 <SEP> that sounds nice.
33 <SEP> that's not very nice.
33 <SEP> uh oh, that sounds bad.
33 <SEP> that is pretty hard my dude.
33 <SEP> i see, well hang in there.
33 <SEP> sounds like its time to get out and start doing something to take your mind off from it.
33 <SEP> it's nice to have friends to revel in our victories.
33 <SEP> i wish that was not the case, i would have came.
33 <SEP> sounds like a plan.
33 <SEP> aw, i bet it wasn't!
33 <SEP> you must have felt terribly lonely!
33 <SEP> that's great!
33 <SEP> that's great!
33 <SEP> you must have been lonely.
33 <SEP> you must have felt quite strange.
33 <SEP> that must've been terrifying for you.
33 <SEP> that is great being so independent.
33 <SEP> sounds like you know what to do.
33 <SEP> that must have been quite lonely.
33 <SEP> oh wow, you must have a lot of responsibility there!
33 <SEP> that sounds difficult.
33 <SEP> that would be discouraging.
33 <SEP> that sucks.
33 <SEP> oh that sucks
33 <SEP> i would let things cool down for awhile and maybe they will have a change of heart.
33 <SEP> that's always a nice alternative, could be worse.
33 <SEP> i bet that was scary!
33 <SEP> ah, your situation sounds complicated.
33 <SEP> it sounds like you've given a lot of thought though, and the way you lay it out, you sound very mature about it.
33 <SEP> you sound like you've dealt with more hardship than the average person.
33 <SEP> it's always nice to go somewhere you can meet a lot of new people.
33 <SEP> ah, i see.
33 <SEP> that would probably do the trick.
33 <SEP> sounds like fun!
33 <SEP> oh, cool!
33 <SEP> i see.
33 <SEP> ah that sucks!
33 <SEP> i can understand that.
33 <SEP> i can understand that.
33 <SEP> it's been both awesome and lonely.
33 <SEP> i see.
33 <SEP> that sounds like fun!
33 <SEP> could be viewed as kind of cool that he's that close with the dog.
33 <SEP> you must have missed him.
33 <SEP> i am sorry, that sounds rough
33 <SEP> i see.
33 <SEP> that is awesome though, you were supporting your team!
33 <SEP> that sucks, i'm sorry to hear it.

33 <SEP> that is strange, i would have got out of there
33 <SEP> i bet that was fun and relaxing
33 <SEP> oh, that sounds lonely :(
33 <SEP> it's always nice to look back on old memories
33 <SEP> wow that sounds like a really big journey.
33 <SEP> it must have been really hard to connect with one another only through online chats.
33 <SEP> oh that's nice, yeah it's a good feature of facebook
