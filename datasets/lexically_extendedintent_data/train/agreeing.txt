32 <SEP> i agree.
32 <SEP> me either, imagine being bitten by one.
32 <SEP> so i know how it is.

32 <SEP> i guess i can agree with that.
32 <SEP> me neither.
32 <SEP> i agree, i try not to think about that, hopefully they will learn to treat others better.
32 <SEP> i know how that feels, and anyone who doesn't consider the safety of others isn't that great of a person.
32 <SEP> i know insurance can be a pain to deal with!
32 <SEP> it gets me too scared.

32 <SEP> me too!
32 <SEP> i agree.
32 <SEP> i can definitely see why all those things would scare you and make you think you saw a ghost.
32 <SEP> me too, sometime, i had the same feeling about someone walking behind me.
32 <SEP> you're right it is a father's responsibility to protect his family.
32 <SEP> i agree, get those things out!
32 <SEP> oh, that is definitely a change!
32 <SEP> me too, i used to be afraid of aliens.
32 <SEP> me too, sometimes i still get scared to stare into mirrors in the dark
32 <SEP> hahaha, me too definitely
32 <SEP> oh that sucks, i know how that feels, its why i got an extra job online
32 <SEP> i know a guy that kind of gets blackout drunk like that.

32 <SEP> me either.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> it worries me too

32 <SEP> yes, i agree it's a big concern.
32 <SEP> absolutely!
32 <SEP> i know the type.
32 <SEP> i understand that.
32 <SEP> you should definitely first talk to your friend and clear out the concerns with him before talking to his partner
32 <SEP> that's right up your alley.
32 <SEP> that could definitely be tough.
32 <SEP> i absolutely will!
32 <SEP> ok, now i understand.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> i understand that, i don't even like going to the gym, because i feel like people are always watching me and it makes me feel awkward.
32 <SEP> you are absolutely right there.
32 <SEP> oh i know what you mean!
32 <SEP> i know how much it stinks to feel left out of everything
32 <SEP> yea i know what you mean
32 <SEP> i agree.
32 <SEP> i agree, i just get on and close my eyes
32 <SEP> they accomplish the opposite of their goal when they become too overpowering over their customers.

32 <SEP> i know pets are just like family.
32 <SEP> definitely be careful then!
32 <SEP> that's absolutely devastating.
32 <SEP> i would have to agree with you there.
32 <SEP> i agree.
32 <SEP> i understand.the emotional value is inrepleacable
32 <SEP> aww, i am so sorry for your lost, i know this is a very hard time for you
32 <SEP> definitely need to make sure it doesn't fall off!
32 <SEP> i know how you feel.
32 <SEP> i have lost all my grandparents so i know the feeling.
32 <SEP> and you're right, i probably shouldn't have brought up getting another one so soon, it just sounded like you'd be a good owner, since you seem like you care so much.
32 <SEP> i completely understand, i've been in that predicament and it sucks.
32 <SEP> that is absolutely devastating news to read.
32 <SEP> i know what you mean.
32 <SEP> there's absolutely nothing i can say to make you feel better about that.
32 <SEP> i know how you feel.
32 <SEP> i know how you feel.
32 <SEP> i know!
32 <SEP> i would definitely take as long as you need, so you don't put unhealthy pressure or expectation on the animal to live up to a memory it can't live up to.
32 <SEP> i'm sorry, i know that must make you sad and stressed.
32 <SEP> oh definitely.
32 <SEP> i know you can do it!
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> i know how hard it is to lose a pet!
32 <SEP> i know what a crushing experience the passing of a beloved pet can be.
32 <SEP> that would definitely be a difficult thing to find out.
32 <SEP> i understand!
32 <SEP> me too.
32 <SEP> i know it's very hard to lose a loved one, i lost my sister, father, and both sets of grandparents.
32 <SEP> i know exactly how you feel.
32 <SEP> oh definitely.
32 <SEP> yes i agree.
32 <SEP> i know the feeling.
32 <SEP> i was together with my wife for 7 years when she left me so i know your pain.
32 <SEP> i agree!
32 <SEP> i hope everything works out for you, i know how hard shut downs can be.
32 <SEP> i definitely agree you need to set up the boundaries.
32 <SEP> i loved my grandparents on my mother's side , so i understand how you feel.
32 <SEP> i have friends who have recently lost their lifelong pets and i know they're still reeling to some extent.
32 <SEP> i know what you mean, i love it so much.
32 <SEP> i know how important a great teacher can be your life.
32 <SEP> i agree.
32 <SEP> i agree, you have done the right thing.
32 <SEP> i know how you feel because i have been there more times then i want to remember.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> none that i know of!
32 <SEP> i understand, i'm sure your family misses you as well.
32 <SEP> my dog is also like family to me, so i understand.
32 <SEP> i understand your feelings.
32 <SEP> sadly, i agree with you.
32 <SEP> that is exactly what i've been going through along with horrible doctors that did nothing for me.
32 <SEP> awww i completely understand.
32 <SEP> that is true i agree with you, that is not what friends do
32 <SEP> absolutely, it's a chapter of your life and as long as you have those memories they live on through those memories.
32 <SEP> i know right.
32 <SEP> the meaningfulness is definitely something you can never replace.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> than i completely understand that would be so hard
32 <SEP> i understand how you feel, i used to have one like that, when it passed away, i got a puppy of the same exact breed and gave it the same name.
32 <SEP> i'm very glad, and i understand how the memories are.
32 <SEP> definitely.
32 <SEP> i moved once from md to fl so i know how you feel being without your peeps.
32 <SEP> i can agree.
32 <SEP> it's very hard to lose a loved one, i know from personal experience.
32 <SEP> i know the feeling.
32 <SEP> i know that was the case for many, i am sorry that impacted you
32 <SEP> that's definitely better than nothing.
32 <SEP> it's hard to lose them i know.
32 <SEP> i know how you must feel.
32 <SEP> me too!
32 <SEP> i know because sometimes technology doesnt work the way we want it too.. i hope you get to be together again soon.
32 <SEP> i know that's gonna to be a terrible loss for the family.
32 <SEP> i understand
32 <SEP> i know she will make it.
32 <SEP> i understand, i have 4 cats myself.
32 <SEP> ah me too.
32 <SEP> me too
32 <SEP> i somewhat disagree.
32 <SEP> oh man i know how you feel.

32 <SEP> i know, you just have to take it one day at a time
32 <SEP> yeah, you're right.
32 <SEP> definitely
32 <SEP> i know the feeling.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> i know that's tough.
32 <SEP> i know that feeling, it will get better.
32 <SEP> i know you will be great in the end.
32 <SEP> i know that would be hard.
32 <SEP> i know what that is like unfortunately.
32 <SEP> yes definitely.
32 <SEP> i understand you not being able to stop.
32 <SEP> i know it can be discouraging when your trying so hard.
32 <SEP> i know what you mean!
32 <SEP> i know how it feels to lose a pet.
32 <SEP> i know the feeling, it makes you wish time would slow down
32 <SEP> thats right, going through the same feeling with my son
32 <SEP> i know that is a tough thing.
32 <SEP> i know that can be really tough.
32 <SEP> i completely understand the grief.
32 <SEP> sometimes it's just best to be quiet, even though you know you are right, to help things get better.
32 <SEP> that happened to me too when i was in elementary school.
32 <SEP> i agree.
32 <SEP> me too!!
32 <SEP> i know, the free time is the best.
32 <SEP> i agree.
32 <SEP> i agree with you
32 <SEP> i know how that can be such a struggle.
32 <SEP> that is a long life for a cat, and i know that makes it even harder.
32 <SEP> i know how hard that can be for the family as well.

32 <SEP> that is correct.
32 <SEP> congrats because i know you will definitely overcome the pains
32 <SEP> i know how you feel.
32 <SEP> it could end today if everyone came to an agreement.

32 <SEP> i know what you mean, no one can get to you like your mom.
32 <SEP> i know how you feel.

32 <SEP> it would definitely be hard.
32 <SEP> i've lost both of mine, i know how you feel.

32 <SEP> i completely understand.
32 <SEP> i know what you mean, life gets more complicated as you get older :)
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> i know how much my husbands pocket knives mean to him.
32 <SEP> i know my husband is bad about leaving his laying around and forgetting where they are.
32 <SEP> i know, at least with my son i get to experience some of that still.
32 <SEP> my dog had congestive heart failure and died so i know how sad that can be
32 <SEP> i know the feeling.
32 <SEP> oh that is wonderful i know that means a lot to you.
32 <SEP> i am sure it did and i know you will treasure that mug.
32 <SEP> losing a loved one is definitely one of the hardest things in life.
32 <SEP> i know for sure you would have enjoyed it again
32 <SEP> i understand that, going through those albums can really make you think about how peaceful things used to be.
32 <SEP> me too.
32 <SEP> me too.
32 <SEP> i definitely feel you on the responsibilities part!
32 <SEP> i know right <3.
32 <SEP> you should definitley pick them up again.
32 <SEP> older songs definitely have more texture and quality to them compared to the manufactured stuff we have that all sounds the same
32 <SEP> i know exactly what you mean!
32 <SEP> i know, christmas was the best when we were children.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> me too.
32 <SEP> i know what you mean.
32 <SEP> i know exactly what you are talking about!
32 <SEP> yes, and i know there are still some fans around now too.
32 <SEP> i am sorry, we all have our moments of wanting to go back in time, i know i do.

32 <SEP> absolutely!
32 <SEP> i know what you mean.
32 <SEP> yeah i know what you mean, those days were the best
32 <SEP> yeah exactly, i think back on those days very fondly

32 <SEP> i agree.
32 <SEP> oh ok i understand
32 <SEP> i know it happened with me.
32 <SEP> i'd definitely agree to that.
32 <SEP> i know how you feel, being young and at the beach was a fun time
32 <SEP> that i think you are right
32 <SEP> me too.
32 <SEP> i know that feeling
32 <SEP> i know right.
32 <SEP> i know.
32 <SEP> exactly what i was thinking.
32 <SEP> i know the feeling.
32 <SEP> oh okay, now i know.
32 <SEP> i get that some too.

32 <SEP> ah yes, i know what you mean.
32 <SEP> me too.
32 <SEP> i know it has die hard fans though.
32 <SEP> you must be a very good mechanic to do all that - i know the amount of work it takes!
32 <SEP> i know right.
32 <SEP> yeah i agree, those days will never come back!
32 <SEP> i agree, be grateful for those in your life because they help you become a better person.
32 <SEP> i agree....were you just looking through some photos or what
32 <SEP> i know how you feel, i didn't see my parents for a couple of years
32 <SEP> i know that nostalgic feeling.
32 <SEP> absolutely, that makes me want to go look at some pictures.
32 <SEP> oh, yeah i understand that, it is the same way with my girlfriend now
32 <SEP> i understand it is usually hard moving to a new city leaving some many people and placed behind
32 <SEP> i know right.
32 <SEP> if it makes you feel peace of happiness, definitely!
32 <SEP> that is even better i know how you feel i lost my grand pa and he was everything to me i miss him dearly.
32 <SEP> i completely agree.
32 <SEP> haha, yea, although some people i know haven't changed at all.
32 <SEP> i understand, life can do that to you, and looking back always bring fond memories
32 <SEP> i can agree with that, adulting sucks
32 <SEP> definitely.
32 <SEP> i definitely need to learn how to take care of cars.
32 <SEP> me too haha!
32 <SEP> thats right.
32 <SEP> i agree when i hear music from the older generation i be like now this is some real music.
32 <SEP> i agree, i often reminisce about my childhood.
32 <SEP> i know, right.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> i couldn't agree more,  sometimes it feels like i was a little kid just yesterday.
32 <SEP> yeah i completely understand that.
32 <SEP> i know right!
32 <SEP> no bills is definitely great.
32 <SEP> i know how that could be, an old trip down memory lane can make you reflect on so much.
32 <SEP> me too!
32 <SEP> i understand
32 <SEP> i agree.
32 <SEP> i agree.
32 <SEP> i know what you mean.
32 <SEP> that happens to me all the time too, it's a treat to remember such great times.
32 <SEP> me too.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> yes i understand!
32 <SEP> oh yea i know the feeling
32 <SEP> oh i know how that feels.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> plus now you'll definitely buy again with them so i think it works in their favor and yours!
32 <SEP> i know you can do this.
32 <SEP> so, i understand how dogs can be with food at times haha.
32 <SEP> yeah, i know.
32 <SEP> i understand that, i am not either with some of my family!
32 <SEP> i have been in that position with a credit card i forgot to pay when we moved and they didn't have the correct forwarding address.
32 <SEP> you're definitely overthinking it.
32 <SEP> i know, and i know it can be really hard to deal with that guilt.
32 <SEP> yeah stress gets to me too!
32 <SEP> i once got hit in the face with one, so i know it can sting.
32 <SEP> oof i know how that can feel.
32 <SEP> yeah that's definitely the way to go.
32 <SEP> i understand, people do it all of the time
32 <SEP> i know how it feels.
32 <SEP> maybe you can send me some too
32 <SEP> oh yea i know what you mean
32 <SEP> me either.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> as a clumsy person, that could've definitely been me in your situation so i get it.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> i know that feeling.
32 <SEP> i know the feeling too well!
32 <SEP> i definitely suggest a nice home-cooked meal, it's usually a lot healthier than take out.
32 <SEP> i understand, it's hard to find the time for everything sometimes.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> yes, just remember everyone can agree to disagree and be ok.
32 <SEP> i understand that
32 <SEP> i know how you feel.
32 <SEP> me too lol
32 <SEP> i understand.
32 <SEP> yeah and i understand.
32 <SEP> yea i agree.
32 <SEP> wow that must be gross, i know it would make me feel like throwing up too
32 <SEP> there's definitely something wrong if they won't call a pest control company.
32 <SEP> yeah i know what you ean!
32 <SEP> i understand that, i hate bugs, even alive ones
32 <SEP> oh, wow, that is absolutely terrible!
32 <SEP> all people are the same.i understand why you feel ver sad and i guess frustrated too
32 <SEP> i would definitely not pay and never go back again.
32 <SEP> that is definitely a no- no
