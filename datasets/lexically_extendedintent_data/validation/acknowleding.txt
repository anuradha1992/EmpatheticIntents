33 <SEP> it must have been so embarrassing!
33 <SEP> oh no that must have been a terrible experience, i hope no one got hurt from the shattered glass.
33 <SEP> the best thing to do there is to just show off your sense of humor and ability to make fun of yourself and not take yourself too seriously, which it sounds like maybe you did.
33 <SEP> sounds like something on a movie!
33 <SEP> i bet they were lol atleast you can laugh about it now.

33 <SEP> oh no, i bet that was stressful.
33 <SEP> to be honest little holes sounds like an easy fix.
33 <SEP> ugh, that sounds wonderful, i would do the same if i were stressed i think
33 <SEP> sounds like a good idea.
33 <SEP> that was really nice of you to apologize like that.
33 <SEP> that must have made you feel terrible.
33 <SEP> that sounds like a great idea!
33 <SEP> i've tried a few, and i would have to say the one that i liked the most was weight watchers.
33 <SEP> it's pretty easy to stay on, and the food is usually good.
33 <SEP> that sounds horrible!
33 <SEP> well, i can understand that.
33 <SEP> i would have done the same as well
33 <SEP> that sounds pretty disturbing.
33 <SEP> i would have also!
33 <SEP> i bet you was so disgusted that you ran out of there.
33 <SEP> ouch, that sounds pretty gross!
33 <SEP> i would have flipped and never talked to him again.
33 <SEP> and he actually is a pretty nice guy, mostly because he's been affectionate from the start.
33 <SEP> i can image, that's pretty disgusting.
33 <SEP> that would be a bad start to the weekend.
33 <SEP> that sounds really disgusting!
33 <SEP> i would have been beyond angry!
33 <SEP> that sounds revolting!
33 <SEP> that sounds like a good plan.
33 <SEP> i would have been too
33 <SEP> i would have lost my lunch right then and there!
33 <SEP> i would have been more annoyed if they didnt.
33 <SEP> that is gross, i can't even imagine what that would taste like!
33 <SEP> lol that's pretty gross.
33 <SEP> yeah, that sounds annoying.
33 <SEP> that sucks, imagine being in an environment like that all day, i would go crazy
33 <SEP> i see, glad he is ok.
33 <SEP> i would have had a gag reflex if i saw some one puking at the bar.
33 <SEP> wow they must have had 1 too many drinks if they could not even get to the bathroom.
33 <SEP> eww that sounds horrible!
33 <SEP> that was nice of her.
33 <SEP> i would be grossed out too.
33 <SEP> your coworker sounds like a shady little b**ch did you let him/her know what's up
33 <SEP> that sounds like sabotage to me.
33 <SEP> it sucks that you have to keep such a close eye on your things in front of family.
33 <SEP> he sounds like a pretty bad person.
33 <SEP> wao,thats really not cool
33 <SEP> that was so awesome of your mom :)
33 <SEP> i bet he knew he was in trouble.
33 <SEP> that sounds awful!
33 <SEP> that would make me so mad!
33 <SEP> oh man i'd be mad too...you should wait outside with a paintball gun
33 <SEP> i would have a hard time forgiving that betrayal of trust.
33 <SEP> i would have called the cops on her!
33 <SEP> they made really strange shuffling sounds and a lot of times didn't even read.
33 <SEP> i am sorry to hear that, i would have felt the same way.
33 <SEP> seriously, i can understand how frustrating that is.
33 <SEP> that's nice of your neighbor!
33 <SEP> yeah, that is pretty annoying to have happen.
33 <SEP> yeah, that is a scary thing to think about too
33 <SEP> that's awesome, i wish i could build my own house.
33 <SEP> that sucks.
33 <SEP> i would've been very angry too.
33 <SEP> that's not cool
33 <SEP> sounds like a wacky place to work.
33 <SEP> i dont know why they work in the service industry if they don't like to be nice
33 <SEP> sounds scary.
33 <SEP> oh that sucks...did she explain herself yet
33 <SEP> sounds like you need a new friend or your own car...or both lol
33 <SEP> i bet you were, i did that to my husband when i was young.
33 <SEP> dang, that sucks.
33 <SEP> yeah, that guy sounds like a jerk.
33 <SEP> oh that sucks!
33 <SEP> wow... that would be one of my worst fears.
33 <SEP> that sounds like a good idea.
33 <SEP> i like a nice sunny day.
33 <SEP> that sounds very frustrating.
33 <SEP> and scary.
33 <SEP> that would be a memorable lesson to learn.
33 <SEP> that sounds like very bad treatment, you should sue them
33 <SEP> that wasn't nice.
33 <SEP> i would have been really mad as well!
33 <SEP> i would too at this point.
33 <SEP> yeah i bet that was a little embarrassing.
33 <SEP> i would have been annoyed as well.
33 <SEP> that sounds really frustrating.
33 <SEP> that's pretty hypocritical.
33 <SEP> i would have complained.
33 <SEP> aww man, that sucks, i am guessing that you end up having to do all the dirty work because he has been slacking off.
33 <SEP> that sounds unfortunate.
33 <SEP> you must have been so annoyed with him!
33 <SEP> yes, that would certainly give them a taste of their own medicine!
33 <SEP> that sucks!
33 <SEP> i hate wasps and most other bugs, so i feel your annoyance.
33 <SEP> sounds like the best thing to do honestly
33 <SEP> yeah, it really sounds like she didn't mean to.
33 <SEP> that's pretty rude and bad in general for an employee to be doing.
33 <SEP> oh man, sounds like most kids.
33 <SEP> i can understand your position.
33 <SEP> i would be too.
33 <SEP> sounds like it's time for a crate.
33 <SEP> it must've been nasty like puke
33 <SEP> that sucks!
33 <SEP> it sounds like a very challenging environment to work in.
33 <SEP> that sucks.
33 <SEP> i would be mad too
33 <SEP> well, that's not cool.
33 <SEP> sounds like a nightmare!
33 <SEP> oh that sounds really annoying.
33 <SEP> oh i see, well good luck to you, i hope you'll solve it soon.
33 <SEP> i would have been so disgusted and outraged!
33 <SEP> that must have been a terrible experience.
33 <SEP> i think that calls for a nice steak dinner out - on his dime!
33 <SEP> i would have them towed!
33 <SEP> that sucks!
33 <SEP> that was nice of her
33 <SEP> wow thats awesome!
33 <SEP> that's really cool.
33 <SEP> that  sounds like a really awesome car!
33 <SEP> sounds wasteful to me.
33 <SEP> it is nice to have a day off every now and then
33 <SEP> sounds like me when i moved from indiana to florida.
33 <SEP> i can understand the feeling, i went through a couple of spells like that in the past.
33 <SEP> oh that is awesome for your friend!
33 <SEP> yeah i can understand that.
33 <SEP> awesome!
33 <SEP> oh man those are super nice!
33 <SEP> oh man, that must have hurt.
33 <SEP> sounds like your friend broke bro code, that was kind of scummy.
33 <SEP> aww man that sucks, one day your hard work will pay off, so don't let it get to you too much.
33 <SEP> wow, thats a nice car
33 <SEP> wow, cool.
33 <SEP> it sounds like you're happy for her, which is commendable given you didn't get hired.
33 <SEP> yeah, i can understand that.
33 <SEP> nice, what a legend and a gentleman
33 <SEP> i would have been to.
33 <SEP> that doesn't sound too good.
33 <SEP> i feel you!
33 <SEP> that does sound like a really fun job.
33 <SEP> oof that sucks.
33 <SEP> that is a nice car
33 <SEP> that sounds like a blast.
33 <SEP> that sounds like a bummer.
33 <SEP> wow thats nice.
33 <SEP> oh i can understand that!
33 <SEP> that's great!
33 <SEP> sounds like the best course to me :)
33 <SEP> i would be envious too.
33 <SEP> i can understand that.
33 <SEP> aww man that sucks for you
33 <SEP> sales do sound hard to do
33 <SEP> well i mean sounds like favortism to me.
