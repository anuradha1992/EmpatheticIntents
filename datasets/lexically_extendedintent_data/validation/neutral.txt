40 <SEP> i've done that as well where nothing ends up happening but i bought all this stuff.
40 <SEP> oh god, how did you .
40 <SEP> ooo i love doing that, but not so much the upheaval in the midst of it.
40 <SEP> i wish i had your confidence when i was in school.
40 <SEP> i was doing the same thing!
40 <SEP> hard work but so satisfying when you see the results!
40 <SEP> that was very smart thinking on your part.
40 <SEP> that was probably a good plan to buy them ahead of time
40 <SEP> i think my favorite and easiest would have to be atkins but still alot of prep to get started
40 <SEP> good thing you were prepared.
40 <SEP> my engineering exams were killer.
40 <SEP> aww haha how many bags did you bring
40 <SEP> they are but to just be able to continue throughout another day is a great feeling.
40 <SEP> if i felt like i had enough people to kind of "rescue me" and who i could talk to at the party if i got anxious and couldn't talk to strangers, then that'd be alright.
40 <SEP> yea open book make you think you dont need to study but that isnt true at all
40 <SEP> no sense wasting time while cooking by looking for odds and ends.
40 <SEP> we took our daughter and her cousin camping about 2 weeks ago!
40 <SEP> well, at least you didn't go down in your grade.
40 <SEP> but, it wasn't right to treat the students like that!
40 <SEP> yea but id still manage to leave something behind anyway haha.
40 <SEP> but not sure about the ready for anything
40 <SEP> i wasn't even aware there was a hurricane.
40 <SEP> i never took chemistry.
40 <SEP> i don't mind winter either but you're so right, the temperature is just right during fall.
40 <SEP> i'm not a father yet, but i can only imagine your kids growing up and leaving to live their own lives.
40 <SEP> in the winter i can be comfy and i can always just put on a jacket if i get too cold, but in the summer it is not that easy.
40 <SEP> yea thank god he didnt go to the gsw
40 <SEP> i do not play too much because if i do not win, i feel it is a waste of money.
40 <SEP> first few days will be weird but you'll slip in no problem once you adjust to your schedule.
40 <SEP> always good to hear the stories were someone gets away!
40 <SEP> that's all you can do, but if you worked hard, i'm sure you will get it!
40 <SEP> i do not yet but hope to one day.
40 <SEP> oh i hadn't even thought of avocado.
40 <SEP> i was in the middle of no where so pretty much felt like idaho where i lived in ny.
40 <SEP> studying can be hard, but sometimes it's about technique rather than time spent.
40 <SEP> dang.. my old roommate was an engineering student.
40 <SEP> he always told me how hard it was.
40 <SEP> well looks like that didn't work out for him in the end.
40 <SEP> i bought a spin bike but i haven't used it yet
40 <SEP> i wish i had a dog now!
40 <SEP> sure i did!
40 <SEP> i wish i had kids to bring to stuff like that.
40 <SEP> i will do that, i had no idea.
40 <SEP> i was too
40 <SEP> personally i'm a huge fan of red velvet, but black forest is amazing too!
40 <SEP> i wish i had a helpful family.
40 <SEP> i was always a daddy's boy growing up.
40 <SEP> mine was a good man.
40 <SEP> i majored in business but sometimes i wish i majored in engineering.
40 <SEP> oh geeze, i didn't know i was talking to a genius.
40 <SEP> was it real because i get those every day lol
40 <SEP> it'll be difficult at first, but you'll get the hang of it.
40 <SEP> i bet you all had a blast!
40 <SEP> he was lucky to have you waiting there for him!
40 <SEP> i've always been a mac kind of girl, but i would look into a surface is i was in the market for a new computer.
40 <SEP> i got a bamboo tablet a few years ago, but i feel like working directly on the screen would be even better.
40 <SEP> well, i don't want to break it to you, but those guys are fictional....
40 <SEP> hahaha hope you did very well
40 <SEP> i did well too
40 <SEP> i wish i was going with you!
40 <SEP> i wish i had a green thumb.
40 <SEP> i bet you had tons of catching up to do!
40 <SEP> no, i never did.
40 <SEP> oh i get that, i had that happen near one of my wisdom teeth too.
40 <SEP> but it is also the best feeling ever!
40 <SEP> best advice i ever got was that housework can wait and take naps whenever you cam when the baby sleeps!
40 <SEP> i didn't know that place was still in business.
40 <SEP> haha, and even if you did, dogs are worth it.
40 <SEP> but gamble only in moderation!
40 <SEP> well i've woken up from a dream and been mad at my husband because of something he did in my dream - i guess it can go the other way too!
40 <SEP> hope were going to the beach thats closest to us!
40 <SEP> i did snorkelling in the philippines at it was amazing.
40 <SEP> that was on the island of coron
40 <SEP> wish every day was like that.
40 <SEP> but a part of her is still here in you.
40 <SEP> i have no kids, but would love to have some at some point!
40 <SEP> cleaning sucks, but after all that hard work, the results are amazing!
40 <SEP> it's always a let down when you go out and it isn't is good as you were hoping.
40 <SEP> hope you didn't get kicked too much!
40 <SEP> so did you help him / her
40 <SEP> i wish i had one.
40 <SEP> that's heartbreaking, but you're amazing for doing that.
40 <SEP> that was kind of you, i am sure they appreciated that!
40 <SEP> you did say a ton!
40 <SEP> i just had to put mine down a few weeks ago.
40 <SEP> i wish i had the courage to do so, too.
40 <SEP> i happen to be a dog person, but i do have a cat that was my ex boyfriends.
40 <SEP> i can't say i have had any mean dogs as of yet.
40 <SEP> the emotions might be difficult to deal with, but at least there are some positives there for you to take stock of
40 <SEP> nursing can be difficult, but if you have determination and a good support system, i'm sure you'll do great!
40 <SEP> that was great of him!
40 <SEP> someone was watching over her.
40 <SEP> there will always be people that are jealous of your success, but it is up to you to be the bigger person and handle it with grace.
40 <SEP> my mom was the same way.
40 <SEP> well, if it was pretty innocuous there's no harm and keeping confidentialiy
40 <SEP> i'm assuming that he/she didn't return it in time.
40 <SEP> i've had a lot of betrayal in the past.
40 <SEP> not for naught but, a dog won't ever betray you <3
40 <SEP> you're lucky the cow didnt hurt you.
40 <SEP> i used to fly a lot but not anymore.
40 <SEP> oh, well that was a smart thing to do.
40 <SEP> looks like you did.
40 <SEP> something to check into to see which end its coming from, but none the less it will happen!
40 <SEP> it's hard to trust anything, even the oatmeal recently was put on the news that its high in cancer causing pest spray.
40 <SEP> oh that's good, last time my computer broke was a day before i left the country
40 <SEP> i took it to the apple store and it actually got fixed in 5 mins, just needed a hardware reset
40 <SEP> my experience was quite opposite as i sat waiting in the dentist chair for a 2 1/2 hour procedure!
40 <SEP> my daughter just got a degree in art but she hasn't been able to find a job yet.
40 <SEP> it's a subtle, but important diffeence
40 <SEP> that was a difficult subject for me after physics.
40 <SEP> i have never surfed but love to be on a boat.
40 <SEP> that's an anxiety-inducing but hopeful situation!
40 <SEP> that was bad.
40 <SEP> i feel ya but sometimes temptation is good gets the heart pumping
40 <SEP> most of my friend have had in the past just wanted to benefit from our relationship,it was not genuine.
40 <SEP> i'd never get to  do anything if my girlfriend didn't trust me.
40 <SEP> our thoughts are were everything starts.
40 <SEP> life is very unfair but we can go at any minute, so cherish those you love!
40 <SEP> but you must take care of yourself too- take some time for yourself when being a caregiver ok!
40 <SEP> i don't care much for the runny yogurt, but i like greek yogurt so long as it's whole fat and sweet.
40 <SEP> i have always had guys doing the same and it means nothing to me.
40 <SEP> i had that dvd.
40 <SEP> i was so jealous of brad pitt over the years
40 <SEP> i sure it was beautiful
40 <SEP> wish i was smart like that
40 <SEP> that was very sweet they don't have to actually do that.
40 <SEP> i sure hope he wasn't hurt.
40 <SEP> ok, then.if it was a 1 thing only, no problem.
40 <SEP> i wish i was able to make things
40 <SEP> but i have a lot of work experience.
40 <SEP> and why did he hide it!
40 <SEP> you could get him a present for his birthday or christmas that was related to drawing tools/pencils and all that.
40 <SEP> i heard there was one guy that makes about $500,000 a month playing it on the streaming service twitch.
40 <SEP> omg, thankfully he wasn't hurt.
40 <SEP> that had to be relief.
40 <SEP> thats so cute, but you have to be carefull not to say bad words in fron of them
40 <SEP> omg, well it is a bad thing but now you can be more polite in front of them, and also when you are not with them!
40 <SEP> a deer did bounce over my car once, though
40 <SEP> i guess they didn't do as good a job as they should have, lol.
40 <SEP> wish my car dealership had missed a few hundred bucks!
40 <SEP> well, it was worth $500!
40 <SEP> that's about what my car's worth these days - had it for years.
40 <SEP> he was my favorite character!
40 <SEP> i wish my friends did that
40 <SEP> i wish i was lucky like that!
40 <SEP> but at least he finally has!
40 <SEP> i didn't know that.
40 <SEP> we had deer around where i used to live - they're gorgeous creatures.
40 <SEP> i've been one time but i was too young to drink or gamble so it was a little boring.
40 <SEP> that is hot, but it is a bit hotter where i live here
40 <SEP> the sun is beautiful but sometimes it can be brutal when it starts to heat up.
40 <SEP> i get that things are hard but.... its bad to never come in.
40 <SEP> i honestly have never gone to jury duty , but im sure it was still a pain to put it on your schedule
40 <SEP> i remember when my first child started, i was a nervous wreck.
40 <SEP> was it a ballet.
40 <SEP> so, it was your partner who used you card
40 <SEP> that's amazing, i have only had one brithday party like that in my life.
40 <SEP> you did!
40 <SEP> you were probably just being you.
40 <SEP> but that is so relatable.
40 <SEP> that's hilarious, but i also feel bad for you.
40 <SEP> i lived in kansas for a while and we had a storm that did a lot of damage.
40 <SEP> took out the power all day and stuff.
40 <SEP> not the best way to start living somewhere far from home, but i'm sure she figured something out.
40 <SEP> that was lucky.
40 <SEP> losing power is bad, but at least that was it.
40 <SEP> you did the right thing!
40 <SEP> that was close
40 <SEP> i've been to the ocean a few times but i've never even seen a surfer.
40 <SEP> we had a small boogie board.
40 <SEP> my father-in-law just got bitten by a black snake recently-not poisonous-but still painful.
40 <SEP> flying always makes me nervous but i usually make it ok.
40 <SEP> if this were a movie, i'd be yelling at the screen for you to leave the house and not go down there.
40 <SEP> well, at least they didn't follow you.
40 <SEP> my parents are from there but i've never been.
40 <SEP> i've only had one creepy experience - that was in an old house in west virginia.
40 <SEP> that is a huge blessing, i don't know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone.
40 <SEP> i've only been on one roller coaster and it was rather small, but i loved it!
40 <SEP> hi, a few months ago, my mother found some stray dogs that were starving, so she told us about them.
40 <SEP> my heart went out to them, as their ribs were showing, but they were still so loving and sweet.
40 <SEP> we did for all of them, with the puppies being able to stay together.
40 <SEP> you were very smart.
40 <SEP> but, i think you're suppose to do the prompts, so hope it doesn't cause you a rejection.
40 <SEP> i am not sure why, but the term "howling monkeys" makes me giggle.
40 <SEP> but you have recovered now.
40 <SEP> interesting....did you do it
40 <SEP> i would make a complaint to the principal if i were you!
40 <SEP> i went to school 3 hours from my home and it was still hard to meet new people
40 <SEP> that is a lot of extra money to spen, but it is completely understandable it you are that nervous about it.
40 <SEP> i'm sure it did!
40 <SEP> please tell me you didn't do it.
40 <SEP> i was wondering how you could type and spell so well for a 6 year old.
40 <SEP> good thing you found someone who had as big of feet as you do!
40 <SEP> was it because you didn't know if you could do the work, or because of all the hot college girls
40 <SEP> but sometimes if the pay is good, it can outweigh some of the negatives.
40 <SEP> i have considered it myself but feel the same as you.
40 <SEP> the journey there is always the toughest, its years of practice and studying but in the end it will be totally worth it
40 <SEP> its not so bad, it can be intimidating but you just need to figure out the campus layout and classes but its very smooth from there
40 <SEP> just relax more you got this and it was just a fender bender.
40 <SEP> at least you did it.
40 <SEP> lance armstrong did not learn until he was 13.
40 <SEP> love, it took me 12 years with the same person to build up the courage to ask her to marry me.
40 <SEP> most kids love being home-schooled but i guess she missed socializing and interacting with her peers.
40 <SEP> i guess you could say you lucked out, but that may be me speaking too prematurely
40 <SEP> i was very nervous.
40 <SEP> i did not know if i would pass or not.
40 <SEP> me, too--i'm sorrry you had to go through that.
40 <SEP> i wish i had  sister like you when i was pregnant.
40 <SEP> i doubt it's anything you did.
40 <SEP> you did you part!!
40 <SEP> i imagine it was a big college.
40 <SEP> that's ok, you did the right thing.
40 <SEP> but at least no one stole anything from your car.
40 <SEP> oh no, were you okay
40 <SEP> at least you didn't lock them inside your car.
40 <SEP> i kind of wish i were there to see it.
40 <SEP> but that happens (it has happened to me several times).
40 <SEP> at least you had the great workout!
40 <SEP> i can imagine that you did want to run and hide.
40 <SEP> it reminded me of the time i did that to my teacher in school.
40 <SEP> i was embarrassed, but it made me feel better to find out that it seems like it's a common thing that happens, since they're female authority figures that you can easily mix up.
40 <SEP> oh no, i've had a few days like that.
40 <SEP> but hey, i think the best way to get over moments like those is to just laugh at yourself!
40 <SEP> it wasn't something on purpose at least.
40 <SEP> oof yea that seems like it might take a few years or 10 before you can laugh at it but at least its over.
40 <SEP> i once spilt tea over my laptop and the keys were all sticky for a while
40 <SEP> since you didn't hurt yourself i think i will have to laugh.
40 <SEP> i bet you meant well but you're left looking like a crazy person!
40 <SEP> oh no, i've had that happen before, it is the worst.
40 <SEP> i've had some pretty embarrassing things happen while hungover.
40 <SEP> i was livid!
40 <SEP> that has happened to me, but with texts though lol
40 <SEP> it's always hard making that step, but it's good for your health to do it.
40 <SEP> once i fell in high school from a puddle and laughed it off even though i was hurt,
40 <SEP> that wasn't smart.
40 <SEP> that is good to hear, it was a motivation to succeed, a great character building
40 <SEP> if i had a bag of m&m's right now i would eat them for sure!
40 <SEP> you know that you had a problem and you are better now for it
40 <SEP> i love dogs a lot but an aggressive dog is very dangerous.
40 <SEP> i'm sure she wasn't that upset.
40 <SEP> i did the same thing today, so you are not alone in your behavior friend!
40 <SEP> i never liked it when a teacher did that when a child needed to go to the bathroom!
40 <SEP> i would feel the same way but you just have to think...who cares what others think!
40 <SEP> i bet they didn't.
40 <SEP> it's always difficult when you feel self-conscious - but i've learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself.
40 <SEP> i am sure you could have passed if you had studied.
40 <SEP> that is good that you gave it back and were able to admit your mistake.
40 <SEP> especially later when you were more in control again.
40 <SEP> i wish there was better quality control with some of these companies that deal in parts.
40 <SEP> i have lost grandparents and greatparents but they were all older in age so it was easier to deal with.
40 <SEP> or did you.
40 <SEP> barney was the name of my hamster.
40 <SEP> that makes sense why you got upset but in the end we're all gonna follow them and you never now you may see them again
40 <SEP> at least she had a good long life.
40 <SEP> our pup was our daughter's dog and she was sick prior to passing, so we knew it was coming.
40 <SEP> we ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom.
40 <SEP> well all the matters is that no one was hurt.
40 <SEP> you can buy property again but not lives.
40 <SEP> oh no, i'm sure that was a hard memory to have brought up for you.
40 <SEP> i used to have a dog we loved so much who had diabetes...we gave him insulin shots twice a day but we lost him.
40 <SEP> neither did we.
40 <SEP> he seemed so healthy, and then within weeks he was so sick he couldn't even talk.
40 <SEP> it will help you relax like it did me!
40 <SEP> it is hard to say goodbye to people but he is doing a wonderful thing at least.
40 <SEP> i would be devastated if i was in your shoes.
40 <SEP> it gets better with time but it must be hard
40 <SEP> it just takes time but a good support system makes it way better.
40 <SEP> that makes me feel ill so i'm sure you were sick.
40 <SEP> i haven't had an animal die yet but my cat is 13 and i'm dreading the day
40 <SEP> i've always had at least one pet throughout my life, and they're truly part of the family.
40 <SEP> i was supporting england too,
40 <SEP> i'm sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family.
40 <SEP> i have heard that is a common side effect but you might want to talk to your doctor about it
40 <SEP> it's none of my business but sometimes when people feel this way, they could be experiencing depression.
40 <SEP> i don't think i've ever had a delivery guy be that late.
40 <SEP> most of my family spoke french as a second language when i was growing up and i still never picked it up!
40 <SEP> those were rough times.
40 <SEP> i have never had a dog.
40 <SEP> i did a research on a cancer vaccine
40 <SEP> that's sweet, i had the same experience with my own grandma too.
40 <SEP> you gave him a good long life, that was the best you could do.
40 <SEP> that is unfortunate, my own mother was ill for several years, she is getting older as well.
40 <SEP> aw, but they'll always be there for you when you visit.
40 <SEP> i had to do that with my gorgeous lab - i still miss him!
40 <SEP> i missed them a couple of times but i saw them this year
40 <SEP> i did too.
40 <SEP> i actually was in the same situation about a week ago.
40 <SEP> i am sure you did better than you think.
40 <SEP> not this time unfortunatly, but it will in the end
40 <SEP> im sure they had a good excuse.
40 <SEP> if they had not i wouldn't use them again.
40 <SEP> but you probably should study as well.
40 <SEP> i sure wish it wasn't.
40 <SEP> but do they give raises more frequently and do they have better benefits.
40 <SEP> she did better than 25 other people.
40 <SEP> ah, yea, i've had the once or twice.
40 <SEP> a tough situation but at least you were able to realize and adapt!
40 <SEP> but sometimes, you go with your heart not with the law.
40 <SEP> ohh that's rough...did you talk to them about it
40 <SEP> i had the same experience after just 5 years
40 <SEP> she took my daughter with her
40 <SEP> it's a way to be alone with your thoughts, but still be around others.
40 <SEP> the cat didn't like you, oh dear.
40 <SEP> but i'm sure they stil want to be firends with you too
40 <SEP> i have - but not for anything that severe.
40 <SEP> i get lonely somtimes but for the most part it is great!
40 <SEP> well at least you didn't have a lot of people under foot to slow you down.
40 <SEP> but remember he didn't die he went to his forever home.
40 <SEP> i remember one time awhile back i took some pictures of when the aliens landed in my backyard.
40 <SEP> that was some good times!
40 <SEP> i'm sure she didn't want to leave.
40 <SEP> i remember when i was on the school newspaper.
40 <SEP> we were never close growig up.
40 <SEP> i guess that's fair, but i probably would've taken it to the vet.
40 <SEP> you just have to remember what a good life she had with you!
40 <SEP> i always wanted a treehouse but never had a good tree for it.
40 <SEP> some of it but my grandma did save a lot.
40 <SEP> that is not too bad if you had a good time though
40 <SEP> but i was almost always disappointed by the toy once i actually got it.
40 <SEP> mcdonald's was my first job when i was 14 and i remember being stoked i could now collect all the toys even if i didn't play with them!
40 <SEP> i bet you did..
40 <SEP> but i guess that's the thing, you're already as busy as it gets, and unfortunately you can't experience it all.
40 <SEP> this is going to be hilarious but my one memory from that era is when i first heard brittany spears hit me baby one more time song.
40 <SEP> crazy, i didn't know that they still exist either!
40 <SEP> man, those tiny disks were easy to lose.
40 <SEP> brings back all the memories you had as a kid.
40 <SEP> awww, i never had one, but wanted one.
40 <SEP> i do not but we always had sunday breakfast for many years.
40 <SEP> i such it was so nostalgic to talk about old times together.
40 <SEP> i loved that show when i was a kid.
40 <SEP> i never had the lunch box though.
40 <SEP> he did a trick called "around the world" and also one called "the cradle."
40 <SEP> i wasn't good at doing any of them.
40 <SEP> my favorite was the coke commercial at christmas time.
40 <SEP> it's ok to have a cheat day everyone once in a while, but you can't give in.
40 <SEP> i've done that before when i was just annoyed with them.
40 <SEP> i remember when i was in high school i had a similar situation.
40 <SEP> i don't think you should feel bad, you didn't know!
40 <SEP> if she was okay with it.
40 <SEP> it's never right but it's easy.
40 <SEP> that's your decision to make, but i think it would at least put you in control of the situation.
40 <SEP> but have you confessed to her
40 <SEP> i'm sure you weren't a bother
40 <SEP> you did the right thing by telling her though.
40 <SEP> my husband loves sweets, but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it it will get eaten right then.
40 <SEP> i didn't understand you
40 <SEP> well, i am sure you are disappointed, but all you can do now is just get back on the diet again and try to be more dedicated.
40 <SEP> lol, guess you were pretty hungry
40 <SEP> im sure they were looking forward to it.
40 <SEP> some people just cannot help but act rude.
40 <SEP> my husband always did with the kids when he was home.
40 <SEP> i've never had a cat specifically because i've never been good with the idea of being able to train them.
40 <SEP> but i'm biased.
40 <SEP> i have had a few before..we actually rescued a few from our cat :/
40 <SEP> i had ice cream too!
40 <SEP> ha, at least it was good
40 <SEP> oh i'll bet that didn't smell pleasant.
40 <SEP> i'm sure they were thinking waste not, want not.
40 <SEP> or did you throw it away
40 <SEP> i like seafood but that's too much.
40 <SEP> at least it was vomit and not something else.
40 <SEP> oh man, i bet you did.
40 <SEP> but we got to make the best of it, pretty soon elon musk will release flying cars and then life will be amazing again.
40 <SEP> please don't tell me there was a bug in your bread
40 <SEP> wednesdays there's this market i like to go to, but lately it just has so much rotten food
40 <SEP> i would never visit that restaurant ever again if i were you!
40 <SEP> well it isn't as if she did it on purpose dogs always have a reason.
40 <SEP> i'm sure you did.
40 <SEP> that is not very considerate or respectful, plus the dog could get hurt if a vehicle were traveling down the street.
40 <SEP> i sometimes get freaked out, but getting freaked out every now and then is better than having to deal with neighbors.
40 <SEP> people might have more respect if they were forced to clean up other people's trash as well.
40 <SEP> i haven't had a puppy in a long time, but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppy-proof.
40 <SEP> i'd want to say they're worth it, but on that day i wouldn't be so sure, haha.
40 <SEP> oh no,trust me if it were me,she would hear me good!
40 <SEP> oh no, how did you make things right with the manager.
40 <SEP> that was good of you.
40 <SEP> that was probably for the best anyway.
40 <SEP> i remember when we had to save games to 5 inch floppy disks.
40 <SEP> still, the games were great when they worked!
40 <SEP> guessing he didn't get anymore food for dinner lol.
40 <SEP> it was only by a couple dollars a month but i so needed those couple of dollars at the time.
40 <SEP> your boyfriend should've told you that there was no toothpaste earlier.
40 <SEP> i had a dog that used to do that too.
40 <SEP> we even had to put something heavy on top of the lid to keep it from getting in it.
40 <SEP> no, but as mark twain once said, the law is an ass.
40 <SEP> i wonder how that was noted on your report.
40 <SEP> i thought it was the solution to relief from abuse.
40 <SEP> i guess that was what you call a temporary situation.
40 <SEP> i thought i was going to lose it!
40 <SEP> right, i had to end up calling the homeowners association on them
40 <SEP> i wish there was some kind of hotline where you could report a license plate to law enforcement so they would get in trouble for being stupid with kids around
40 <SEP> that was so bad.
40 <SEP> it means he miscalculated the time he was to spend under the water.
40 <SEP> too late i already took it.
40 <SEP> if it were me, i'd call the animal shelter and report possible abuse since the dog does nothing but bark all day - poor thing just needs attention and the owner isn't taking care of it.
40 <SEP> no, i ever did.
40 <SEP> oh no, well at least he didnt hurt the rabbit.
40 <SEP> at some point, they stop but they understand that it is not working.
40 <SEP> it'll be well worth it when she gets the hang of it, but urgh.
40 <SEP> you haven't said anything yet other than asking why i hadn't responded.
40 <SEP> i wish i had a rubber bumper to ram those people with!
40 <SEP> that was very rude of her to do that, some people just have no manners.
40 <SEP> i haven't had cable in so long!
40 <SEP> i would be so lost without my phone, but i could make it through an evening.
40 <SEP> i love dogs but they certainly get do annoying things at times.
40 <SEP> here i was hoping a walmart would open in my area.
40 <SEP> were they driving fast at the time, it could have been quite dangerous.
40 <SEP> i'm sure you did not feel great when you found out
40 <SEP> pets are great, but they can be a bit needy for attention at times.
40 <SEP> it is great, but not when you are busy and trying to get things done.
40 <SEP> i've had similar experiences.
40 <SEP> oh right, i spent some time in florida when i was younger and i remember it being so unpredictable.
40 <SEP> i'm all for saving the planet, but you have to draw the line somewhere.
40 <SEP> it's weird, you buy them all the toys in the world, but they still go after your stuff.
40 <SEP> i never go to the store anymore, i wish i did.
40 <SEP> i wish i was young again sometimes.
40 <SEP> my friend was upset when i left too.
40 <SEP> i'm sure they mean well but you're at a point where you're hurting to get back out there.
40 <SEP> dang, and here i thought i was lucky winning a free soft drink in that contest.
40 <SEP> i do too but it's natural to get envious of others sometimes, don't put yourself down over it.
40 <SEP> o no im not sure that was the best response
40 <SEP> i never had one.
40 <SEP> i didnt know they were expensive
40 <SEP> i like my job but its certainly not like hers!
40 <SEP> they could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are.
40 <SEP> but your time will come, be patient!
40 <SEP> be envious that they were lucky enough to have their parents hand down all their money to them.
40 <SEP> well, i'm not entirely sure about the banking side but i wonder what she's looking for.
40 <SEP> if only it was so easy!
40 <SEP> but we have to make the most of this one.
