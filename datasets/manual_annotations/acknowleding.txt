oh wow, that does suck!
Oh my god, that's so sad to hear.
That's pretty scary
That's good news.
That's awesome.
How exciting! You must be so proud of him. What an accomplishment!
You definitely should be!
Sounds exciting!
That would drive me nuts.
Dang, heartbreaking.
That is really gross. 
They didn't even apologize? Wow, that's rude. 
That sounds like double good news. It was probably fun having your hard work rewarded with seeing the faces of all your loved ones and having them personally congratulate you.
That's horrible. 
That's a tough situation. 
That's really rough. 
Sounds a bit scary. 
Oh my goodness I would have been terrified!
what a horrible experience all round.
Im sure it can be highly rewarding too.
You must have felt hopeful
Cool! 
That's pretty awesome. I have never been that far!
Nice! … Cameras are such a wonderful tool to have these days and there are so many cool options to choose from.
You must be excited!
Wow, how exciting!
Oh wow! lucky you!
Wow, that must be scary to have to trust someone else with all of your stuff.
Oh man! I would be so surprised!
That sounds scary.
Oh, that is so hard. It sounds like she had a long and happy life. I’m sure you miss her so much.
Well, that sounds disgusting.
That sucks!
That was very mean of him.
